Such descriptions of normative driving behaviors can aid in the\ndevelopment of vehicle safety and intelligent transportation systems. The\nmethodology is demonstrated using data from the Second Strategic Highway\nResearch Program (SHRP 2) NDS, which includes over 34 million miles of driving\nacross more than 3,400 drivers. Summaries of each driving metric were generated\nusing vehicle, GPS, and forward radar data. Additionally, interactive online\nanalytics tools were developed to visualize and compare driving behavior across\ngroups through dynamic data selection and grouping. For example, among drivers\non 65-mph roads for the SHRP 2 NDS, females aged 16-19 exceeded the speed limit\nby 7.5 to 15 mph slightly more often than their male counterparts, and younger\ndrivers maintained headways under 1.5 seconds more frequently than older\ndrivers.

Traditionally,\nqueuing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time varying demand\nand fixed capacity. However, field observations show flow rates decrease during\ncongestion at freeway merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic, a\nfactor overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an\nanalytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging\nof autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the\nfirst time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point, reduced by the\nmulti-stage dynamic merging process, is analytically derived using a closed\nform formulation. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue\nlength and traffic delay are derived as the first objective. Additionally, a\ncrash risk function is established to quantitatively assess potential\ncollisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective.\nFinally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly\nminimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision\nvariables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is\nformulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to\nfind the minimum cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset\nvalidate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the\nproposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more\nefficient and safer merging process."}

These tools are\nnot tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive\nto how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot\nlearn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's\nlifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a\nfactor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based\non accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide\npolicy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL\ncan only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward\nNormalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on\nestimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across\nsimulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and\nDoor-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies\nconsistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer\neffectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of\nlearning lifespan-guided tool use strategies."}
