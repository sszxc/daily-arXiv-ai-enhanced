While compliant hardware can facilitate such\ninteractions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow\ntorque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while\naccurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic\nprogramming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on\naccurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model\nmismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce\nRapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,\nprobabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,\nwithout relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's\nproprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a\nprior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the\nunknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator\ndriven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden\nchanges in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\\sim400$ ms, in\nstatic and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario\nwhere a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and\ndynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to\nchanging dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory\nsystem."}

Table tennis\nexemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must\nperceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both\nagility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for\nhumanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory\nprediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based\nwhole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and\ntiming, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that\nmimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive\nrallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are\nincorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose\nhumanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and\nsustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate\nreal-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a\nstep toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors."}

This\npaper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates\nreal-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we\nleverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of\ncreating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,\nPrompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then\nleverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,\nbringing user imaginations into the real world.

However,\ntransferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the\nsim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can\ndegrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization\nand Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle\nunder out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In\nthis work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of\nrelying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly\nadapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve\nthis, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies\nresidual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a\ndifferentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework\nrefines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled\neffects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics\nmodel is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient\nbackpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy\nupdates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of\nour system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to\nunseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on\nagile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the\nreal world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to\nL1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in\nvision-based control without explicit state estimation."}
