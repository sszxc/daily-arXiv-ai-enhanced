We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness).

As standard automation solutions\ntend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting\nproduction costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their\nfull potential. The COOCK+ ROBUST project aims to transform cobots into mobile\nand reconfigurable production assistants by integrating existing technologies,\nincluding 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both\nthe opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these\ntechnologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the\nprocess. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO\nresearch unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete\nimplementation example throughout."}

To achieve that, HRI applications must\npromote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or\novertrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,\nHRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and\navoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical\nconcerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for\nbuilding trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We\nemphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the\nrobot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate\nits intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,\nrobots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs\nwhile providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over\ntheir actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important\nfor bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true\ncapabilities."}

Unfortunately, researchers use the term \"social\ncontext\" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it\nchallenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and\nmodeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,\nwe survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term\n\"social context\". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social\ncontext of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and\nwe discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers\nplan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights\nafter interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open\nresearch questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social\ncontexts of human-robot interactions."}

To address this, we\npioneer \"pointing\" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate\nrepresentation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge\nhigh-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We\nintroduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed\nfor embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and\ngeneral visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale\ndataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing\ncapabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced\nFine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.\nEmbodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and\npointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot\ngeneralization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%\nacross 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,\nrepresenting a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows\nthat a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,\noffers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action\ngap in robotics."}

To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising\nparadigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation\nskills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be\nimproved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is\nlabor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper investigates whether\nstrong generalization in dynamic object manipulation is achievable with only a\nfew demonstrations. Specifically, we develop an entropy-based theoretical\nframework to quantify the optimization of imitation learning. Based on this\nframework, we propose a system named Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation\n(GEM). Extensive experiments in simulated and real tasks demonstrate that GEM\ncan generalize across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments,\nmotion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM has been deployed in a\nreal canteen for tableware collection. Without any in-scene demonstration, it\nachieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations."}
