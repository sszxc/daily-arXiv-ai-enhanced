However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between\nlanguage descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely\ninvoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In\nthis work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language\ninstructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to\ncomplete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set\nobjects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit\nstrong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language\ninstructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,\nleveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with\nvision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view\nvalue maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial\ninformation from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding.

The proposed solution integrates a UAV\nwith ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN)\nfor search missions.

The ROS2 environment utilizes the\nYOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN\nfor face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face\nrecognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV\noperator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and\nimmediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on\nspecific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN\nmodel.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D\nmillimeter-wave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to\nleverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry\nestimation in complex environments.

However, this single-point preview tracking strategy\nfails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control\nactions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its\ncontrol performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.\nTraditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between\ncapturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often\nresulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.\nThis method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a\nLinear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input\nbased on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC\ncalculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by\nadding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and\ninterpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance\noptimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the\nCarsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH\nracing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the\ntraining data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC)\nwhile delivering superior tracking performance. Compared to traditional LMPC,\nRKMPC reduces lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, decreases heading error by\n8.9%-15.8%, and improves front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%.

At the same time, autonomous\nrobotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular\ntools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including\nmeasurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,\nthis paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into\nhow the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design\noptimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We\npropose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement\nmatrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the\nsignal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is\nthe application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying\ntransform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the\nnumber of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution\nmaps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce\nrobot travel distance to less than $10\\%$ of a full-coverage path, while\nimproving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to\ntraditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by\na factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\uff08CS\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DL\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73af\u5883\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684CS\u6d4b\u91cf\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u81f3\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u5f84\u768410%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCS\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad85\u500d\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709IPP\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad82\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73af\u5883\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The two controllers\nfundamentally differ from each other as the first is formulated in task\nacceleration space and the latter is in task force space with passivity\nconsiderations. Even though both control methods predict stability under ideal\nconditions in closed-loop dynamics, their robustness against joint friction,\nsensor noise, unmodeled external disturbances, and non-perfect contact\nconditions is not evident. Therefore, we analyze and experimentally compare the\ntwo controllers on a humanoid robot platform through swing foot position and\norientation control, squatting with and without unmodeled additional weights,\nand jumping.
