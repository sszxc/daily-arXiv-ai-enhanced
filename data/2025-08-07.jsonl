We\npresent Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a\nsingle expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel\nobject geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train\nclosed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and\ngeneralize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior\nwork using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert\ndemonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those\nworks, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as\nkeypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must\ntrack a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To\ngenerate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for\neach task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its\nassociated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint\nconfigurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the\ntransformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to\nthe first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and\nfour real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and\ntight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve\nan average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves\nan average of 50%."}
