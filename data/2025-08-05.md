*Taha Samavati,Mohsen Soryani,Sina Mansouri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对玫瑰花采摘机器人的3D感知流程，通过合成数据集和深度学习优化了稀疏3D定位和深度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球对药用植物（如大马士革玫瑰）的需求增长，但人工采摘效率低，限制了规模化生产。

Method: 采用两阶段算法：先在立体图像上进行2D点检测，再用轻量级深度神经网络估计深度；通过Blender生成合成数据集以减少标注成本。

Result: 在合成数据上2D检测F1分数达95.6%，真实数据为74.4%；深度估计误差在2米范围内为3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为农业自动化提供了可扩展的精准采摘方案，解决了合成与真实数据的领域差距。

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for
precision harvesting.

### [2] [A Survey on Deep Multi-Task Learning in Connected Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00917)
*Jiayuan Wang,Farhad Pourpanah,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Ning Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文综述了多任务学习（MTL）在联网自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）中的应用，探讨了其优势、现有方法的局限性及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用独立模型处理CAVs的多个任务，导致高成本和计算开销，MTL通过统一模型联合学习多任务，提高了效率和资源利用率。

Method: 综述了MTL在CAVs关键功能模块（如感知、预测、规划、控制和多智能体协作）中的应用。

Result: 总结了现有方法的优势和局限性，并指出了研究空白。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以推动MTL在CAV系统中的进一步发展。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

### [3] [BarlowWalk: Self-supervised Representation Learning for Legged Robot Terrain-adaptive Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00939)
*Haodong Huang,Shilong Sun,Yuanpeng Wang,Chiyao Li,Hailin Huang,Wenfu Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BarlowWalk结合自监督表示学习改进PPO方法，显著减少训练时间和对地形感知的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流RL方法训练时间长，影响开发效率，需改进。

Method: 集成Barlow Twins算法构建解耦潜在空间，实现自监督学习。

Result: 在复杂地形场景中表现优异，实验验证有效性。

Conclusion: BarlowWalk方法高效且可信，适用于复杂地形控制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), driven by data-driven methods, has become an
effective solution for robot leg motion control problems. However, the
mainstream RL methods for bipedal robot terrain traversal, such as
teacher-student policy knowledge distillation, suffer from long training times,
which limit development efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes
BarlowWalk, an improved Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method integrated
with self-supervised representation learning. This method employs the Barlow
Twins algorithm to construct a decoupled latent space, mapping historical
observation sequences into low-dimensional representations and implementing
self-supervision. Meanwhile, the actor requires only proprioceptive information
to achieve self-supervised learning over continuous time steps, significantly
reducing the dependence on external terrain perception. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in complex terrain
scenarios. To enhance the credibility of the evaluation, this study compares
BarlowWalk with advanced algorithms through comparative tests, and the
experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Shiyao Sang,Yinggang Ling*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RIMAOS2C是一种基于服务发现的混合网络通信中间件，旨在解决大规模L4自动驾驶部署中的通信问题，支持多种通信模式并优化数据传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人中间件难以满足多样化通信需求、优化数据传输效率及保持调度确定性，尤其是在大规模L4自动驾驶部署中。

Method: 通过多级服务发现组播和消息桥机制，RIMAOS2C支持多种通信模式，并利用共享内存集中分发消息以减少冗余和延迟不确定性。

Result: 在L4车辆和Jetson Orin域控制器上测试，RIMAOS2C消除了消息冗余，大数据传输效率提升36-40%，回调延迟变化减少42-906%。

Conclusion: RIMAOS2C提升了机器人操作系统的通信能力，为自动驾驶分布式计算架构中的通信优化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Robotic middleware is fundamental to ensuring reliable communication among
system components and is crucial for intelligent robotics, autonomous vehicles,
and smart manufacturing. However, existing robotic middleware often struggles
to meet the diverse communication demands, optimize data transmission
efficiency, and maintain scheduling determinism between Orin computing units in
large-scale L4 autonomous vehicle deployments. This paper presents RIMAOS2C, a
service discovery-based hybrid network communication middleware designed to
tackle these challenges. By leveraging multi-level service discovery multicast,
RIMAOS2C supports a wide variety of communication modes, including multiple
cross-chip Ethernet protocols and PCIe communication capabilities. Its core
mechanism, the Message Bridge, optimizes data flow forwarding and employs
shared memory for centralized message distribution, reducing message redundancy
and minimizing transmission delay uncertainty. Tested on L4 vehicles and Jetson
Orin domain controllers, RIMAOS2C leverages TCP-based ZeroMQ to overcome the
large-message transmission bottleneck in native CyberRT. In scenarios with two
cross-chip subscribers, it eliminates message redundancy and improves
large-data transmission efficiency by 36 to 40 percent while reducing callback
latency variation by 42 to 906 percent. This research advances the
communication capabilities of robotic operating systems and proposes a novel
approach to optimizing communication in distributed computing architectures for
autonomous driving.

### [5] [Hestia: Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01014)
*Cheng-You Lu,Zhuoli Zhuang,Nguyen Thanh Trung Le,Da Xiao,Yu-Cheng Chang,Thomas Do,Srinath Sridhar,Chin-teng Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hestia利用强化学习提出了一种通用的5-DoF最佳视角预测方法，解决了3D重建中数据收集效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建数据收集过程耗时且人工密集，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 通过强化学习设计核心组件（数据集选择、观测设计、动作空间、奖励计算和学习方案），构建Hestia系统，并在无人机上验证。

Result: 实验表明Hestia在三个数据集和NVIDIA IsaacLab环境中表现稳健，适合实际部署。

Conclusion: Hestia为自动化数据收集提供了高效、可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled
efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains
largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the
challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for
Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages
reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best
viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines
the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice,
observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes,
forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view
approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation
in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene
exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across
three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab
environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

### [6] [Learning Pivoting Manipulation with Force and Vision Feedback Using Optimization-based Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01082)
*Yuki Shirai,Kei Ota,Devesh K. Jha,Diego Romeres*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 结合模型优化与强化学习，提出一种闭环旋转操作框架，实现高效样本学习和模拟到现实的迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非抓取操作因复杂接触交互而具挑战性，现有模型方法依赖精确信息且对误差敏感，而学习方法需大量数据。

Method: 利用接触隐式轨迹优化（CITO）设计示范引导的深度强化学习，结合特权训练策略实现模拟到现实迁移。

Result: 在多个旋转任务中验证了方法的有效性，成功实现仅依赖本体感知、视觉和力传感的操作。

Conclusion: 提出的框架结合了模型与学习方法的优势，实现了高效且鲁棒的闭环旋转操作。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact
interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based
approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects
under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model
inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass,
size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast,
learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but
require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to
propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By
leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization
(CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),
leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer
approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform
pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing
without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several
pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real
transfer.

### [7] [Improving Drone Racing Performance Through Iterative Learning MPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01103)
*Haocheng Zhao,Niklas Schlüter,Lukas Brunke,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的LMPC方法，通过自适应成本函数、局部安全集和笛卡尔坐标系优化无人机竞速性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机竞速中实时决策和非线性系统动态处理的挑战，提升时间最优性和安全性。

Method: 采用自适应成本函数、局部安全集和笛卡尔坐标系，优化LMPC框架。

Result: 仿真和实验中，初始轨迹优化最高提升60.85%圈速，实际无人机测试提升6.05%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升无人机竞速性能，兼具速度和安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing presents a challenging control problem, requiring
real-time decision-making and robust handling of nonlinear system dynamics.
While iterative learning model predictive control~(LMPC) offers a promising
framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to
drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off
between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with
three key innovations:~(1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights
time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence,~(2)~a shifted local safe
set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates,
and~(3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints
without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame
transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories
generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a
maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85\%. Even applied to the most
aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real
drone, a 6.05\% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method
pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation
and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak
performance of drone racing.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种人机红队范式，用于安全感知推理，旨在提升机器人在高风险任务中的安全性和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注机器人能力提升，而忽视了其在高风险任务中如何安全操作的问题。机器人需赢得人类信任，才能在安全关键任务中有效协作。

Method: 采用人机红队范式，通过人类与机器人合作挑战环境假设，探索潜在危险，实现安全感知推理（危险识别、风险评估、风险缓解和安全报告）。

Result: 实验表明，人机红队能在多种领域安全规划任务，且不同形态的机器人能在不同环境（如月球栖息地和家庭）中安全操作。

Conclusion: 人机红队范式可行，能提升安全关键任务中的人机协作安全性和信任度。

Abstract: While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit
in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in
high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in
order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically
those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot
red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to
work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the
space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform
safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment,
risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red
teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety
of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate
safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with
varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red
teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this
approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in
safety-critical problem domains.

### [9] [COLLAGE: Adaptive Fusion-based Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01131)
*Sateesh Kumar,Shivin Dass,Georgios Pavlakos,Roberto Martín-Martín*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COLLAGE是一种用于少样本模仿学习的集体数据聚合方法，通过自适应融合机制选择相关演示数据，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法仅依赖单一特征距离启发式检索数据的问题，避免引入无关演示数据。

Method: 使用自适应晚期融合机制，基于任务特定组合多线索选择相关演示数据，并通过重要性采样训练策略。

Result: 在仿真和现实任务中分别优于现有方法5.1%和16.6%。

Conclusion: COLLAGE是一种通用且特征无关的方法，能有效结合多线索提升少样本模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation
learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for
a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve
data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best
demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in
visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a
subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental
demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene
layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We
present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation
learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of
relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.
COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to
subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,
appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained
on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are
then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data
more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general
and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by
any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest
benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms
state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in
simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,
where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset. More information

Result: Q8bot具备稳定行走、跳跃和爬坡能力，组装时间短，成本低。

Conclusion: Q8bot是一款适合广泛研究和教育用途的高性能微型机器人。

Abstract: This paper introduces Q8bot, an open-source, miniature quadruped designed for
robotics research and education. We present the robot's novel zero-wire design
methodology, which leads to its superior form factor, robustness,
replicability, and high performance. With a size and weight similar to a modern
smartphone, this standalone robot can walk for over an hour on a single battery
charge and survive meter-high drops with simple repairs. Its 300-dollar bill of
materials includes minimal off-the-shelf components, readily available custom
electronics from online vendors, and structural parts that can be manufactured
on hobbyist 3D printers. A preliminary user assembly study confirms that Q8bot
can be easily replicated, with an average assembly time of under one hour by a
single person. With heuristic open-loop control, Q8bot achieves a stable
walking speed of 5.4 body lengths per second and a turning speed of 5 radians
per second, along with other dynamic movements such as jumping and climbing
moderate slopes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合学习和优化的统一生成-优化框架，通过奖励引导的条件流匹配（CFM）和模型预测路径积分（MPPI）控制，实现动态环境中安全高效的机器人行为规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态、以人为中心的环境中，机器人行为规划需要处理不确定性、实时适应和确保安全，现有方法各有局限。

Method: 结合奖励引导的CFM模型和MPPI控制，实现双向信息交换：CFM提供先验信息，MPPI优化轨迹并反馈给CFM。

Result: 在自主社交导航应用中，该方法能灵活适应动态环境并实时满足安全要求。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合学习和优化，提升了机器人行为规划的安全性和适应性。

Abstract: Planning safe and effective robot behavior in dynamic, human-centric
environments remains a core challenge due to the need to handle uncertainty,
adapt in real-time, and ensure safety. Optimization-based planners offer
explicit constraint handling but rely on oversimplified initialization,
reducing solution quality. Learning-based planners better capture multimodal
possible solutions but struggle to enforce constraints such as safety. In this
paper, we introduce a unified generation-refinement framework bridging learning
and optimization with a novel reward-guided conditional flow matching (CFM)
model and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control. Our key innovation is
in the incorporation of a bidirectional information exchange: samples from a
reward-guided CFM model provide informed priors for MPPI refinement, while the
optimal trajectory from MPPI warm-starts the next CFM generation. Using
autonomous social navigation as a motivating application, we demonstrate that
our approach can flexibly adapt to dynamic environments to satisfy safety
requirements in real-time.

*Buqing Nie,Yang Zhang,Rongjun Jin,Zhanxiang Cao,Huangxuan Lin,Xiaokang Yang,Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SE-Policy是一种新的DRL框架，通过嵌入对称等变性（actor）和对称不变性（critic）来提升人形机器人的协调性和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRL方法忽视了机器人的形态对称性，导致行为不协调和性能不佳。受人类运动控制的启发，作者提出了SE-Policy。

Method: SE-Policy在actor中嵌入严格的对称等变性，在critic中嵌入对称不变性，无需额外超参数。

Result: 在速度跟踪任务中，SE-Policy比现有方法提高了40%的跟踪精度，并实现了更好的时空协调性。

Conclusion: SE-Policy有效且适用于人形机器人，展示了对称性在DRL中的重要性。

Abstract: The human nervous system exhibits bilateral symmetry, enabling coordinated
and balanced movements. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot,
leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor
control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL
framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry
invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces
consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and
spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive
experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and
real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that
SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability
to humanoid robots.

TL;DR: VLH是一种新型视觉-语言-触觉基础模型，统一了无人机和虚拟现实中的感知、语言和触觉反馈，实现了实时交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将触觉作为次要反应通道，而VLH通过视觉理解和语言指令直接生成触觉反馈，提升交互体验。

Method: 采用8英寸四轴飞行器，配备双逆向五连杆阵列进行触觉反馈，结合视觉和语言输入，通过微调的OpenVLA模型输出7维动作向量。

Result: 在90次飞行实验中，目标获取成功率为56.7%，纹理识别准确率100%，在新任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: VLH展示了触觉反馈与感知推理的协同进化能力，推动了沉浸式人机交互的发展。

Abstract: We present VLH, a novel Visual-Language-Haptic Foundation Model that unifies
perception, language, and tactile feedback in aerial robotics and virtual
reality. Unlike prior work that treats haptics as a secondary, reactive
channel, VLH synthesizes mid-air force and vibration cues as a direct
consequence of contextual visual understanding and natural language commands.
Our platform comprises an 8-inch quadcopter equipped with dual inverse five-bar
linkage arrays for localized haptic actuation, an egocentric VR camera, and an
exocentric top-down view. Visual inputs and language instructions are processed
by a fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone - adapted via LoRA on a bespoke dataset of 450
multimodal scenarios - to output a 7-dimensional action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx,
Hy, Hz, Hv). INT8 quantization and a high-performance server ensure real-time
operation at 4-5 Hz. In human-robot interaction experiments (90 flights), VLH
achieved a 56.7% success rate for target acquisition (mean reach time 21.3 s,
pose error 0.24 m) and 100% accuracy in texture discrimination. Generalization
tests yielded 70.0% (visual), 54.4% (motion), 40.0% (physical), and 35.0%
(semantic) performance on novel tasks. These results demonstrate VLH's ability
to co-evolve haptic feedback with perceptual reasoning and intent, advancing
expressive, immersive human-robot interactions.

Motivation: 通过残差学习改进预规划轨迹，使其更适应动态任务需求。

Result: 实验显示残差学习在样本效率和任务性能上优于从头训练。

Conclusion: 框架在仿真和实际硬件中均表现良好，仿真到现实的差距小。

Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement
Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference
trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories.
This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and
motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring
modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it
generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives
to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory
refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning
significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving
superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further
validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be
directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong
learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in
real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task
correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning.
Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the
Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System
(hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and
the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and
cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the
framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via
parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic
submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent
architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations
on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline
(Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the
closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing
new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory,
long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning
capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks.
RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a
foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical

*Shutong Jin,Lezhong Wang,Ben Temming,Florian T. Pokorny*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理逆向渲染的照明增强框架，用于提升模仿学习在真实世界中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习在环境变化（如光照变化）下的泛化能力不足，需要新的数据增强方法。

Method: 利用逆向渲染分解视频帧的几何和材质属性，结合Stable Video Diffusion进行时间一致性增强。

Result: 在7自由度机器人上减少了40.1%的行为克隆泛化差距，并在6种光照条件下进行了720次真实世界评估。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了模仿学习的泛化能力，并展示了三种下游应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite advances in data augmentation, policies trained via imitation
learning still struggle to generalize across environmental variations such as
lighting changes. To address this, we propose the first framework that
leverages physically-based inverse rendering for lighting augmentation on
real-world human demonstrations. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the
first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and
material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to
render appearance changes under different lighting. To ensure consistent
augmentation across each demonstration, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on
robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our
framework by measuring the structural and temporal consistency of the augmented
sequences, and by assessing its effectiveness in reducing the behavior cloning
generalization gap (40.1%) on a 7-DoF robot across 6 lighting conditions using
720 real-world evaluations. We further showcase three downstream applications
enabled by the proposed framework.

*Jack Zeng,Andreu Matoses Gimenez,Eugene Vinitsky,Javier Alonso-Mora,Sihao Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出首个去中心化方法，利用多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练微型飞行器（MAV）团队实现6自由度负载操控，无需全局状态或通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制器多为集中式，依赖全局信息和通信，限制了可扩展性和灵活性。

Method: 通过MARL训练外环控制策略，仅依赖负载姿态观测进行隐式通信，设计线性加速度和体速率的动作空间。

Result: 实验验证了在负载模型不确定性和单机失效情况下的鲁棒性，性能媲美集中式方法。

Conclusion: 去中心化方法具有高可扩展性、低计算成本，且能可靠地实现仿真到现实的迁移。

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF
manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles
(MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train
an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers
that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,
inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents
communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high
scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs
during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,
we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration
and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,
enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused
by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various
real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model
uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst
agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete
in-flight loss of one MAV. Videos of experiments:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HALO是一种新颖的离线奖励学习算法，通过量化人类导航直觉为视觉奖励函数，用于机器人导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将人类直觉转化为机器人导航的奖励函数，提升导航性能。

Method: 利用离线数据和专家轨迹，通过Plackett-Luce损失训练奖励模型，结合用户反馈。

Result: HALO在真实场景中表现优异，成功率和轨迹质量显著提升。

Conclusion: HALO在学习和经典导航框架中均表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce HALO, a novel Offline Reward Learning algorithm
that quantifies human intuition in navigation into a vision-based reward
function for robot navigation. HALO learns a reward model from offline data,
leveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training,
actions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using
preference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the
preferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive
navigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to
align with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO,
we deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline
learned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a
model-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward
as an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both
learning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments
on a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained
with HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not
present in the training data. HALO outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based
navigation methods, achieving at least a 33.3% improvement in success rate, a
12.9% reduction in normalized trajectory length, and a 26.6% reduction in
Frechet distance compared to human expert trajectories.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种无参考且独立于恶劣天气条件的框架Advent，通过利用短时同质性解决域适应问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件（如雾、雨）对自动驾驶感知任务构成挑战，现有域适应方法依赖清晰参考且难以应对多种天气混合情况。

Method: Advent框架包含三个组件：局部序列机制（LSM）、全局混洗机制（GSM）和展开正则化器（URs），利用短时同质性实现天气无关性。

Result: 在语义分割任务中，Advent大幅超越现有基准方法。

Conclusion: Advent通过无参考和天气无关设计，有效提升了自动驾驶感知任务在恶劣天气下的性能。

Abstract: Various adverse weather conditions such as fog and rain pose a significant
challenge to autonomous driving (AD) perception tasks like semantic
segmentation, object detection, etc. The common domain adaption strategy is to
minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather
conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically
relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain
in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and
performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather
conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse
weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model
architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is
achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of
clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition.
Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential
Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to
achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind
arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed
to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence
to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded
Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed
regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather
generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess
the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large
margins.

*Sung-Wook Lee,Xuhui Kang,Brandon Yang,Yen-Ling Kuo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLASS方法通过对比学习和动作序列监督提升行为克隆在异构数据集上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行为克隆在异构数据集（如不同相机视角或物体外观）中因过拟合而泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 利用动态时间规整（DTW）识别相似动作序列，通过监督对比学习和软InfoNCE损失优化行为表示。

Result: 在5个仿真和3个真实任务中表现优异，视觉显著变化下扩散策略预训练成功率75%。

Conclusion: CLASS通过对比学习有效提升行为克隆的泛化性能，尤其在视觉变化场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have led to strong performance in
robotic manipulation, driven by expressive models, sequence modeling of
actions, and large-scale demonstration data. However, BC faces significant
challenges when applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with
different camera poses or object appearances, where performance degrades
despite the benefits of learning at scale. This stems from BC's tendency to
overfit individual demonstrations rather than capture shared structure,
limiting generalization. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via
Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral
representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning.
CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with
similarity-weighted positive pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation
benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve competitive results using
retrieval-based control with representations only. Most notably, for downstream
policy learning under significant visual shifts, Diffusion Policy with CLASS
pre-training achieves an average success rate of 75%, while all other baseline
methods fail to perform competitively. Project webpage:

TL;DR: VFP是一种基于流匹配的机器人操作策略，通过变分潜在先验和Kantorovich最优传输解决多模态问题，显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流匹配方法在多模态任务中表现不佳，VFP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入变分潜在先验、K-OT对齐和MoE解码器，实现多模态动作生成。

Result: 在41个任务中，VFP比基线方法任务成功率提升49%。

Conclusion: VFP在多模态任务中高效且紧凑，适合机器人操作。

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach
for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in
action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional
flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to
averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this,
we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a
variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively
captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further
incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level
alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode
specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41
tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and
sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show
that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over
standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact
model size. More details are available on our project page:

Conclusion: EPDS框架在时间和能量效率上表现优异，适用于无人机配送网络。

Abstract: We propose a novel Energy-Predictive Drone Service (EPDS) framework for
efficient package delivery within a skyway network. The EPDS framework
incorporates a formal modeling of an EPDS and an adaptive bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) machine learning model. This model predicts the
energy status and stochastic arrival times of other drones operating in the
same skyway network. Leveraging these predictions, we develop a heuristic
optimization approach for composite drone services. This approach identifies
the most time-efficient and energy-efficient skyway path and recharging
schedule for each drone in the network. We conduct extensive experiments using
a real-world drone flight dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed
framework.

TL;DR: DexReMoE框架通过混合专家策略和物体类别信息，实现了对复杂形状物体的通用重定向能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂形状物体的重定向问题，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 使用混合专家（MoE）框架训练多个专家策略，并结合物体类别信息作为特权输入。

Result: 在150种物体上平均连续成功次数达19.5，最差性能从0.69提升至6.05。

Conclusion: DexReMoE展示了在通用手内重定向任务中的可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: In hand object reorientation provides capability for dexterous manipulation,
requiring robust control policies to manage diverse object geometries, maintain
stable grasps, and execute precise complex orientation trajectories. However,
prior works focus on single objects or simple geometries and struggle to
generalize to complex shapes. In this work, we introduce DexReMoE (Dexterous
Reorientation Mixture-of-Experts), in which multiple expert policies are
trained for different complex shapes and integrated within a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) framework, making the approach capable of generalizing across a wide
range of objects. Additionally, we incorporate object category information as
privileged inputs to enhance shape representation. Our framework is trained in
simulation using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluated on novel
out-of-distribution objects in the most challenging scenario of reorienting
objects held in the air by a downward-facing hand. In terms of the average
consecutive success count, DexReMoE achieves a score of 19.5 across a diverse
set of 150 objects. In comparison to the baselines, it also enhances the
worst-case performance, increasing it from 0.69 to 6.05. These results
underscore the scalability and adaptability of the DexReMoE framework for
general-purpose in-hand reorientation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究地形可穿越性对自主机器人在非结构化环境中的重要性，探索视觉语言模型的潜力。

Method: 提出一个简单流程，整合视觉语言模型进行零样本估计，并使用人工标注数据集验证。

Result: 实验结果显示当前基础模型尚不适合实际部署，但揭示了人类评估的主观性和一致性。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在地形可穿越性估计中表现有限，但为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Terrain traversability estimation is crucial for autonomous robots,
especially in unstructured environments where visual cues and reasoning play a
key role. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer potential for zero-shot
estimation, the problem remains inherently ill-posed. To explore this, we
introduce a small dataset of human-annotated water traversability ratings,
revealing that while estimations are subjective, human raters still show some
consensus. Additionally, we propose a simple pipeline that integrates VLMs for
zero-shot traversability estimation. Our experiments reveal mixed results,
suggesting that current foundation models are not yet suitable for practical
deployment but provide valuable insights for further research.

Result: 在ScanNet200和Matterport3D数据集上，OpenMap在零样本设置下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: OpenMap有效弥合了自由形式语言与3D感知之间的差距，提升了导航任务中的指令定位能力。

Abstract: Grounding natural language instructions to visual observations is fundamental
for embodied agents operating in open-world environments. Recent advances in
visual-language mapping have enabled generalizable semantic representations by
leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). However, these methods often fall
short in aligning free-form language commands with specific scene instances,
due to limitations in both instance-level semantic consistency and instruction
interpretation. We present OpenMap, a zero-shot open-vocabulary visual-language
map designed for accurate instruction grounding in navigation tasks. To address
semantic inconsistencies across views, we introduce a Structural-Semantic
Consensus constraint that jointly considers global geometric structure and
vision-language similarity to guide robust 3D instance-level aggregation. To
improve instruction interpretation, we propose an LLM-assisted
Instruction-to-Instance Grounding module that enables fine-grained instance
selection by incorporating spatial context and expressive target descriptions.
We evaluate OpenMap on ScanNet200 and Matterport3D, covering both semantic
mapping and instruction-to-target retrieval tasks. Experimental results show
that OpenMap outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in bridging free-form language
and 3D perception for embodied navigation.

Conclusion: 角色扮演隐喻是未来人机交互设计中强调创造力、表现力和直观性的有效方法。

Abstract: Gestures are an expressive input modality for controlling multiple robots,
but their use is often limited by rigid mappings and recognition constraints.
To move beyond these limitations, we propose roleplaying metaphors as a
scaffold for designing richer interactions. By introducing three roles:
Director, Puppeteer, and Wizard, we demonstrate how narrative framing can guide
the creation of diverse gesture sets and interaction styles. These roles enable
a variety of scenarios, showing how roleplay can unlock new possibilities for
multi-robot systems. Our approach emphasizes creativity, expressiveness, and
intuitiveness as key elements for future human-robot interaction design.

Motivation: 解决手动鼻气管插管中的交叉感染和黏膜损伤风险，填补自动化鼻气管插管的研究空白。

Method: 开发了嵌入力传感器的自主系统，并设计了RACCT模型处理复杂的管-组织交互和部分视觉观察。

Result: RACCT模型在所有方面优于ACT模型，平均峰值插入力减少66%，成功率与手动操作相当。

Conclusion: 该系统有效降低感染风险并提高操作安全性，验证了其临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is critical for establishing artificial airways
in clinical anesthesia and critical care. Current manual methods face
significant challenges, including cross-infection, especially during
respiratory infection care, and insufficient control of endoluminal contact
forces, increasing the risk of mucosal injuries. While existing studies have
focused on automated endoscopic insertion, the automation of NTI remains
unexplored despite its unique challenges: Nasotracheal tubes exhibit greater
diameter and rigidity than standard endoscopes, substantially increasing
insertion complexity and patient risks. We propose a novel autonomous NTI
system with two key components to address these challenges. First, an
autonomous NTI system is developed, incorporating a prosthesis embedded with
force sensors, allowing for safety assessment and data filtering. Then, the
Recurrent Action-Confidence Chunking with Transformer (RACCT) model is
developed to handle complex tube-tissue interactions and partial visual
observations. Experimental results demonstrate that the RACCT model outperforms
the ACT model in all aspects and achieves a 66% reduction in average peak
insertion force compared to manual operations while maintaining equivalent
success rates. This validates the system's potential for reducing infection
risks and improving procedural safety.

Conclusion: GMC模型和扩展模型为磁连续体机器人的设计和应用提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: Magnetic soft continuum robots are capable of bending with remote control in
confined space environments, and they have been applied in various
bioengineering contexts. As one type of ferromagnetic soft continuums, the
Magnetically Induced Metamorphic Materials (MIMMs)-based continuum (MC)
exhibits similar bending behaviors. Based on the characteristics of its base
material, MC is flexible in modifying unit stiffness and convenient in molding
fabrication. However, recent studies on magnetic continuum robots have
primarily focused on one or two design parameters, limiting the development of
a comprehensive magnetic continuum bending model. In this work, we constructed
graded-stiffness MCs (GMCs) and developed a numerical model for GMCs' bending
performance, incorporating four key parameters that determine their
performance. The simulated bending results were validated with real bending
experiments in four different categories: varying magnetic field,
cross-section, unit stiffness, and unit length. The graded-stiffness design
strategy applied to GMCs prevents sharp bending at the fixed end and results in
a more circular curvature. We also trained an expansion model for GMCs' bending
performance that is highly efficient and accurate compared to the simulation
process. An extensive library of bending prediction for GMCs was built using
the trained model.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has revolutionized the healthcare industry by
providing surgeons with greater precision, reducing invasiveness, and improving
patient outcomes. However, the success of these surgeries depends heavily on
the robotic system ability to accurately interpret the intentions of the
surgical trainee or even surgeons. One critical factor impacting intent
recognition is the cognitive workload experienced during the procedure. In our
recent research project, we are building an intelligent adaptive system to
monitor cognitive workload and improve learning outcomes in robot-assisted
surgery. The project will focus on achieving a semantic understanding of
surgeon intents and monitoring their mental state through an intelligent
multi-modal assistive framework. This system will utilize brain activity, heart
rate, muscle activity, and eye tracking to enhance intent recognition, even in
mentally demanding situations. By improving the robotic system ability to
interpret the surgeons intentions, we can further enhance the benefits of
robot-assisted surgery and improve surgery outcomes.

Conclusion: 这项研究为模块化机器人系统提供了一种新思路，即通过利用环境特征来突破其固有局限。

Abstract: Modular robotics research has long been preoccupied with perfecting the
modules themselves -- their actuation methods, connectors, controls,
communication, and fabrication. This inward focus results, in part, from the
complexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile
laboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the
Variable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and
reveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In
this work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better
robot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular
robots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion,
adaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from
simple two-dimensional robot assemblies. By using environment features --
ledges, gaps, and slopes -- we show how the environment can extend the robots'
capabilities. Nature has long mastered this principle: organisms not only
adapt, but exploit their environments to their advantage. Robots must learn to
do the same. This study is a step towards modular robotic systems that
transcend their limitations by exploiting environmental features.

Conclusion: L3M+P通过知识图谱检索和验证，提升了自然语言状态更新和规划准确性。

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs),
recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks
given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose
service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally
require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is
not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on
isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term
continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the
environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as
planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper
introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge
graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from
multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language
interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the
absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At
planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves
context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for
classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world
service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods
both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly
generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

Abstract: World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic
simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators
with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness
of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if
the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a
pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric
employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model
predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially
controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are
interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the
standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego
vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where
top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego
agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we
propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to
uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as
pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world
models under these new metrics.

Abstract: The convergence of autonomous indoor drones with physics-aware sensing
technologies promises to transform property assessment from subjective visual
inspection to objective, quantitative measurement. This comprehensive review
examines the technical foundations enabling this paradigm shift across four
critical domains: (1) platform architectures optimized for indoor navigation,
where weight constraints drive innovations in heterogeneous computing,
collision-tolerant design, and hierarchical control systems; (2) advanced
sensing modalities that extend perception beyond human vision, including
hyperspectral imaging for material identification, polarimetric sensing for
surface characterization, and computational imaging with metaphotonics enabling
radical miniaturization; (3) intelligent autonomy through active reconstruction
algorithms, where drones equipped with 3D Gaussian Splatting make strategic
decisions about viewpoint selection to maximize information gain within battery
constraints; and (4) integration pathways with existing property workflows,
including Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems and industry standards
like Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6.

Conclusion: 该设计在狭窄空间导航和抓取任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor design capable of folding its arms
vertically to grasp objects and navigate through narrow spaces. The
transformation is controlled actively by a central servomotor, gears, and
racks. The arms connect the motor bases to the central frame, forming a
parallelogram structure that ensures the propellers maintain a constant
orientation during morphing. In its stretched state, the quadrotor resembles a
conventional design, and when contracted, it functions as a gripper with
grasping components emerging from the motor bases. To mitigate disturbances
during transforming and grasping payloads, we employ an adaptive sliding mode
controller with a disturbance observer. After fully folded, the quadrotor frame
shrinks to 67% of its original size. The control performance and versatility of
the morphing quadrotor are validated through real-world experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation
have driven significant progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in
isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we
observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP),
suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present
NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI
navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically,
NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that
generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii)
employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better
generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient
learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain
benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI
navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation
studies further confirm the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data
mixing strategy, and reward design.

Conclusion: RICL为VLA模型提供了简单高效的上下文学习接口，提升了其在实际应用中的适应性。

Abstract: Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated
increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving
non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments.
However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means
to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability
to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly
useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.
Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not
naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the
right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible
to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining
for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a
small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the
most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit
ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to
inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large
in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20
demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates
on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts
performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST
alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning
interface for new manipulation tasks. Website: https://ricl-vla.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 功能对象排列（FORM）任务中，指令通常不明确，缺乏目标姿态的具体描述，SetItUp旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SetItUp通过两阶段方法：1) 使用LLM生成Python程序预测物体间的抽象空间关系图；2) 预训练扩散模型组合预测物体姿态。

Result: 在餐桌、书架和卧室家具布置任务中，SetItUp生成的排列功能性强、物理可行且美观，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SetItUp通过神经符号方法有效解决了FORM任务中的目标姿态预测问题，扩展了RSS 2024会议论文的工作。

Abstract: Functional object arrangement (FORM) is the task of arranging objects to
fulfill a function, e.g., "set up a dining table for two". One key challenge
here is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not
explicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,
a neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects
from a few training examples and a structured natural-language task
specification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract
spatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate
representation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)
predicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the
grounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to
induce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.
This program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.
For (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture
primitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object
poses based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning
three distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing
items on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom. Experiments show
that SetItUp outperforms existing models in generating functional, physically
feasible, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements. This article extends
our conference paper published at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2024.

Result: 在多样化物体上达到最先进的识别精度，并支持零样本文本引导操作。

Conclusion: ScrewSplat简单高效，适用于真实场景中的关节物体识别与操作。

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry
and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling
robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However,
existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of
articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve
complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting
their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce
ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB
observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which
are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic
structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously
reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.
We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy
across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,
text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Conclusion: 该框架在力基机器人任务中实现了长期可靠性，显著减少人工干预需求。

Abstract: The automation of robotic tasks requires high precision and adaptability,
particularly in force-based operations such as insertions. Traditional
learning-based approaches either rely on static datasets, which limit their
ability to generalize, or require frequent manual intervention to maintain good
performances. As a result, ensuring long-term reliability without human
supervision remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an
adaptive self-supervised learning framework for insertion classification that
continuously improves its precision over time. The framework operates in
real-time, incrementally refining its classification decisions by integrating
newly acquired force data. Unlike conventional methods, it does not rely on
pre-collected datasets but instead evolves dynamically with each task
execution. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate how the system
progressively reduces execution time while maintaining near-perfect precision
as more samples are processed. This adaptability ensures long-term reliability
in force-based robotic tasks while minimizing the need for manual intervention.

Conclusion: 矩匹配技术在稀疏和噪声场景中具有强大的点云配准潜力。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in
conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration
methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions
Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate
alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration
framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are
regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the
source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis
moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation
between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit
point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the
consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than
existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM
system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance
and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings
demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud
registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: FedVLA为隐私保护的视觉-语言-动作模型训练提供了有效解决方案，推动了其在机器人操作中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by enabling robots to interpret language instructions for task
execution. However, training these models often relies on large-scale
user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn
limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first
federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that
preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework
integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and
expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving
training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented
Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features
based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively
learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE)
mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively
decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation
strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by
activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive
simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency
compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates
comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.

Conclusion: 无需先验运动学知识，TacMan-Turbo 成功解决了关节物体操作中效率与鲁棒性的权衡。

Abstract: Adept manipulation of articulated objects is essential for robots to operate
successfully in human environments. Such manipulation requires both
effectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and
efficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions.
Existing approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods
relying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering
structural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust
manipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through
reactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces
TacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated
object manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous
approaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals
requiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources
of local kinematic information. This new perspective enables our controller to
predict optimal future interactions and make proactive adjustments,
significantly enhancing manipulation efficiency. In comprehensive evaluations
across 200 diverse simulated articulated objects and real-world experiments,
our approach maintains a 100% success rate while significantly outperforming
the previous tactile-informed method in time efficiency, action efficiency, and
trajectory smoothness (all p-values < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that
the long-standing trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in articulated
object manipulation can be successfully resolved without relying on prior
kinematic knowledge.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for
developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress
inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges
related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training
stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA
models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In
this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework
specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal
difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent
characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT,
an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of
demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation
learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone
and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to
optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world
environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods,
achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle
time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization
capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive lattice-based motion planning solution to
address the problem of generating feasible trajectories for systems,
represented by a linearly parameterizable non-linear model operating within a
cluttered environment. The system model is considered to have uncertain model
parameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update
the model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic
estimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error
reduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives
generated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model
selected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also
equipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal
estimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall
motion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the
size of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive
learning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well
as in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter
and the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of
the implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go
arbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with
the true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion
planning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is
demonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model
represented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and
operating within a cluttered environment.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual
input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of
natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a
wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount
of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,
we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few
demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides
object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the
object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an
instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image
crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target
objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on
both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned
with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates
zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: 多类别检测模型在物理人机协作中可行，滑动窗口预处理策略适用于此类任务。

Abstract: In physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) settings, humans and robots
collaborate directly in shared environments. Robots must analyze interactions
with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical
aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified.
Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish
between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by
evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed
contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot
manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis.
Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets.
The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing,
demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a
comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is
optimal for this task.

Abstract: A key challenge in human-robot interaction research lies in developing
robotic systems that can effectively perceive and interpret social cues,
facilitating natural and adaptive interactions. In this work, we present a
novel framework for enhancing the attention of the iCub humanoid robot by
integrating advanced perceptual abilities to recognise social cues, understand
surroundings through generative models, such as ChatGPT, and respond with
contextually appropriate social behaviour. Specifically, we propose an
interaction task implementing a narrative protocol (storytelling task) in which
the human and the robot create a short imaginary story together, exchanging in
turn cubes with creative images placed on them. To validate the protocol and
the framework, experiments were performed to quantify the degree of usability
and the quality of experience perceived by participants interacting with the
system. Such a system can be beneficial in promoting effective human robot
collaborations, especially in assistance, education and rehabilitation
scenarios where the social awareness and the robot responsiveness play a
pivotal role.

Conclusion: QuaDreamer为解决四足机器人全景数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案，并展示了其在下游任务中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are
suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training
data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration
challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems
tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose
QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for
quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of
quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,
providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively
capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during
quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts
controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and
provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video
generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller
(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter
control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in
wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream
architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail
enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.
We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training
data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the
performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and
model weights will be publicly available at
https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

Motivation: 现实世界中多机器人系统常遇到传感和通信故障，但现有研究对此关注不足，需要一种能区分临时和永久故障的协调方法。

Method: 将机器人团队分组处理：临时故障通过动态路径调整和危险区域规避恢复；永久故障则通过分散或独立优化继续运行。

Result: 在多种故障场景下，框架表现出稳健性能，适用于未知危险区域的现实环境。

Conclusion: 该框架为多机器人系统提供了一种实用且通用的故障感知解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world
deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and
permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly
degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite
its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in
the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the
complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware
coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot
target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our
approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)
probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent
sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding
inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or
communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized
behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned
into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and
collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots
experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate
independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them
to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate
our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive
assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our
framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments
with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for
the multi-robot systems community.

Abstract: In order to expand the operational range and payload capacity of robots,
wire-driven robots that leverage the external environment have been proposed.
It can exert forces and operate in spaces far beyond those dictated by its own
structural limits. However, for practical use, robots must autonomously attach
multiple wires to the environment based on environmental recognition-an
operation so difficult that many wire-driven robots remain restricted to
specialized, pre-designed environments. Here, in this study, we propose a robot
that autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a
multi-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and
environmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an
anchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by
flying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable
attachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in
environments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple
wires simultaneously. Through this approach, a wire-driven robot can
autonomously attach its wires to the environment, thereby realizing the
benefits of wire-driven operation at any location.

Abstract: Robotic cutting is a challenging contact-rich manipulation task where the
robot must simultaneously negotiate unknown object mechanics, large contact
forces, and precise motion requirements. We introduce a new virtual-model
control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators,
without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment.
Motion is generated through interconnection with virtual mechanisms, given by
virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through
analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior
settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator
demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter
slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same
controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and
adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and
platform independence.

Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in orchards presents
significant challenges due to obstacles and GPS-deprived environments. In this
work, we introduce a learning-based approach to achieve vision-based navigation
of UAVs within orchard rows. Our method employs a variational autoencoder
(VAE)-based controller, trained with an intervention-based learning framework
that allows the UAV to learn a visuomotor policy from human experience. We
validate our approach in real orchard environments with a custom-built
quadrotor platform. Field experiments demonstrate that after only a few
iterations of training, the proposed VAE-based controller can autonomously
navigate the UAV based on a front-mounted camera stream. The controller
exhibits strong obstacle avoidance performance, achieves longer flying
distances with less human assistance, and outperforms existing algorithms.
Furthermore, we show that the policy generalizes effectively to novel
environments and maintains competitive performance across varying conditions
and speeds. This research not only advances UAV autonomy but also holds
significant potential for precision agriculture, improving efficiency in
orchard monitoring and management.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.
However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor
policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we
introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that
systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual
monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for
embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system
first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program
grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed
in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected
checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure
reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events
with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and
repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting
program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that
HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of
robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating
multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp and reposition human limbs can significantly enhance
their ability to provide assistive care to individuals with severe mobility
impairments, particularly in tasks such as robot-assisted bed bathing and
dressing. However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the
human remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address
this issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables
robotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our
approach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for
grasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision
avoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with
force closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model
Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to
generate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical
constraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks
in both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age
groups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our
approach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further
showcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks.
