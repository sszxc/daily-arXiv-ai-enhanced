To support LMs while ensuring\nreal-time inference, embodied edge intelligence (EEI) is a promising paradigm,\nwhich leverages an LM edge to provide computing powers in close proximity to\nembodied robots. Due to embodied data exchange, EEI requires higher spectral\nefficiency, enhanced communication security, and reduced inter-user\ninterference. To meet these requirements, near-field communication (NFC), which\nleverages extremely large antenna arrays as its hardware foundation, is an\nideal solution. Therefore, this paper advocates the integration of EEI and NFC,\nresulting in a near-field EEI (NEEI) paradigm. However, NEEI also introduces\nnew challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by isolated EEI or NFC\ndesigns, creating research opportunities for joint optimization of both\nfunctionalities.

However,\nmost existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new\nenvironments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability\ndiminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios.\nIn this paper, we break away from the conventional \"train once, deploy forever\"\nparadigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous\ndriving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are\nprimarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such\nfailures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To\naddress this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,\nusing it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than\nperforming blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to\nidentify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are\nprimarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we\ncompute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints\nfrom the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from\nthe perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then\nbackpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the\nmodel's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion\npredictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.\nExperiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset\ndemonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under\nchallenging conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6EvoPSF\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u548c\u635f\u574f\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0cEvoPSF\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoPSF\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike structured driving environments, parking requires executing\ncomplex maneuvers such as frequent gear shifts and steering saturation. Recent\nattempts to employ imitation learning (IL) for parking have achieved promising\nresults. However, existing works ignore the multimodal nature of parking\nbehavior in lane-free open space, failing to derive multiple plausible\nsolutions under the same situation. Notably, IL-based methods encompass\ninherent causal confusion, so enabling a neural network to generalize across\ndiverse parking scenarios is particularly difficult. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MultiPark, an autoregressive transformer for multimodal\nparking. To handle paths filled with abrupt turning points, we introduce a\ndata-efficient next-segment prediction paradigm, enabling spatial\ngeneralization and temporal extrapolation. Furthermore, we design learnable\nparking queries factorized into gear, longitudinal, and lateral components,\nparallelly decoding diverse parking behaviors. To mitigate causal confusion in\nIL, our method employs target-centric pose and ego-centric collision as\noutcome-oriented loss across all modalities beyond pure imitation loss.\nEvaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that MultiPark achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various scenarios.

It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to\n(i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii)\nto dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray\nnozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not\npossible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying\nand the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In\naddition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift,\nboom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of\nthis complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist.\nTherefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed\nsimpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching.\nThe comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is\nintrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic.\nCombinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as\nthree sections-setups are compared.

We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare the\nperformance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest\nclassifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherry\ntomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, and\nsuccessful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance.\nFurthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU and\ntension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states. This classifier\nenables the planning of corrective actions based on real-time feedback, thereby\nenhancing the efficiency and reliability of fruit harvesting operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u519c\u4e1a\u6293\u53d6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u519c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u4f7f\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u6293\u53d6\u72b6\u6001\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u4e86IMU\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u53cd\u5c04\u3001\u5f20\u529b\u3001\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548cRGB\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u756a\u8304\u690d\u682a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cIMU\u548c\u5f20\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u89c4\u5212\u7ea0\u6b63\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6c34\u679c\u91c7\u6458\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}
