Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle\nmodel parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized\nmusculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring\nthe internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint\ntorques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model\n(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an\nend-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the\nmeasurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting\nobservable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.\nThrough extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our\nproposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline\nmethods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters\n(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the\nground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end\nup with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as\n0.05%).

However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point\nboundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic\nplanning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of\nmotion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based\ndominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse\nrisks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.\nWe propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search\nframework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.\nIGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and\noff-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*\nuse 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version\nof HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*\noutperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive\ncontroller.

We evaluate the\nresulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple\nobject-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual\nlanguage navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments.\nOur experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any\nadditional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA\npolicies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing\nsuccess rate by 27% on navigation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8627%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3002"}}

A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to\nnavigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,\ncorridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and\nhumans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These\nassumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described\ninformally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for\ncomparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners\nto find the papers relevant to their concrete application.

Third, simulations of both humanoid\nand quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and\nversatility of T-WB-DRC.

Hill"], "title": "Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -- The Navigation and Perception Framework in a Mine Site Inspection Robot", "comment": null, "summary": "In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site\nand detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to\nbe inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and\nproperties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in\nmaterial handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow\nand expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological\nproperties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for\nthe development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - \"DIPPeR\". In\nthis paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a\nrobust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based\nnavigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first\nprocesses point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting\nthe cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D\ncone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D\ndomain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.\nWe then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while\nsuppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for\ndown-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable\nautonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection\nparameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity\nand hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This\nallows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal\npoint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system\nin both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests.

Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a\npromising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence\nmodeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations\nstill remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,\nSymbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a\nneuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable\nmulti-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic\nplanner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic\nsubgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer\n(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot\nmanipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,\nand generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.\nWe evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including\nzero-shot and few-shot scenarios.
