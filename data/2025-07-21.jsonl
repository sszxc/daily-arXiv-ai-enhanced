Under review at ASME Journal of Mechanical\n  Design", "summary": "Compliant mechanisms have significant potential in precision applications due\nto their ability to guide motion without contact. However, an inherent\nvulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of\ncompliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly\nchallenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and\nthe cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical\nto prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on\nstacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to\nguarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a\nsystematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in\ncompliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a\nsingle pair of compact hard-stop surfaces. Specifically, we introduce a\ntheoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry\nto maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that\nthe mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method\nto a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and\nprovide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers\nreliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling. This work\nestablishes a foundation for precision hard-stop design in compliant systems\noperating under uncertain loads, which is a crucial step toward enabling the\napplication of compliant mechanisms in real-world systems."}

However, the ability of these\nalgorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space\nbecomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the\nsolution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more\ncomplex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input\nmatrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce\nthe dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of\nthe original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using\nSCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a\nmatrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are\nthen transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the\naddition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.\nSCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series\npose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of\ncompressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension\nis no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates\nthat SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an\nevolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy."}

Most robotic systems today treat their\nphysical form as a fixed constraint rather than an adaptive resource, forcing\nthe same rigid geometric representation to serve applications with vastly\ndifferent computational and precision requirements. We introduce MorphIt, a\nnovel algorithm for approximating robot morphology using spherical primitives\nthat balances geometric accuracy with computational efficiency. Unlike existing\napproaches that rely on either labor-intensive manual specification or\ninflexible computational methods, MorphIt implements an automatic\ngradient-based optimization framework with tunable parameters that provides\nexplicit control over the physical fidelity versus computational cost tradeoff.\nQuantitative evaluations demonstrate that MorphIt outperforms baseline\napproaches (Variational Sphere Set Approximation and Adaptive Medial-Axis\nApproximation) across multiple metrics, achieving better mesh approximation\nwith fewer spheres and reduced computational overhead. Our experiments show\nenhanced robot capabilities in collision detection accuracy, contact-rich\ninteraction simulation, and navigation through confined spaces. By dynamically\nadapting geometric representations to task requirements, robots can now exploit\ntheir physical embodiment as an active resource rather than an inflexible\nparameter, opening new frontiers for manipulation in environments where\nphysical form must continuously balance precision with computational\ntractability."}

Current motion planning methods\noften fail to effectively utilize prior motion experiences and adapt to\nreal-time uncertainties inherent in underwater settings. In this paper, we\nintroduce an Adaptive Heuristic Motion Planner framework that integrates a\nHeuristic Motion Space (HMS) with Bayesian Networks to enhance motion planning\nfor autonomous underwater manipulation. Our approach employs the Probabilistic\nRoadmap (PRM) algorithm within HMS to optimize paths by minimizing a composite\ncost function that accounts for distance, uncertainty, energy consumption, and\nexecution time. By leveraging HMS, our framework significantly reduces the\nsearch space, thereby boosting computational performance and enabling real-time\nplanning capabilities. Bayesian Networks are utilized to dynamically update\nuncertainty estimates based on real-time sensor data and environmental\nconditions, thereby refining the joint probability of path success. Through\nextensive simulations and real-world test scenarios, we showcase the advantages\nof our method in terms of enhanced performance and robustness. This\nprobabilistic approach significantly advances the capability of autonomous\nunderwater robots, ensuring optimized motion planning in the face of dynamic\nmarine challenges."}
