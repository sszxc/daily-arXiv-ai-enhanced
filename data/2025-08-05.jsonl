However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically\nrelies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain\nin practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and\nperforms poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather\nconditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse\nweather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model\narchitecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is\nachieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of\nclear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition.\nSpecifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential\nMechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to\nachieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind\narbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed\nto shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence\nto prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded\nRegularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed\nregularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather\ngeneralization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess\nthe proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large\nmargins."}

However,\nexisting approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of\narticulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve\ncomplex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting\ntheir practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce\nScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB\nobservations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which\nare then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic\nstructure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously\nreconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.\nWe demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy\nacross a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,\ntext-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model."}

Traditional registration\nmethods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions\nTransform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate\nalignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration\nframework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are\nregarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the\nsource and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis\nmoments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation\nbetween two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit\npoint-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the\nconsistency of the proposed method.

The system model is considered to have uncertain model\nparameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update\nthe model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic\nestimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error\nreduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives\ngenerated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model\nselected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also\nequipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal\nestimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall\nmotion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the\nsize of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive\nlearning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well\nas in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter\nand the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of\nthe implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go\narbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with\nthe true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion\nplanning performance over time.

Qureshi"], "title": "Manip4Care: Robotic Manipulation of Human Limbs for Solving Assistive Tasks", "comment": "Accepted to IROS 2025", "summary": "Enabling robots to grasp and reposition human limbs can significantly enhance\ntheir ability to provide assistive care to individuals with severe mobility\nimpairments, particularly in tasks such as robot-assisted bed bathing and\ndressing. However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the\nhuman remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address\nthis issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables\nrobotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our\napproach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for\ngrasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision\navoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with\nforce closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model\nPredictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to\ngenerate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical\nconstraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks\nin both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age\ngroups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our\napproach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further\nshowcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks."}
