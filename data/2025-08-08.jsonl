To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the\nreaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the\neffects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical\nencounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time\naround 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers\nfeel they made the biggest impact on the robot."}

Service has a smaller operational footprint but\nincurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal\nplanning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic\nmerging regulation (HCMR).

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze\nnavigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard\nDDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and\nboosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline\nalgorithms."}

However, their long inference time, resulting from an\nextensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk\nbefore the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their\napplicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle\ntime. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy\nstructures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,\nwhich can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a\nmethod from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging\nsolutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent\niterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference\nand propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such\nas grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces\nruntime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy\nredesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained\ndiffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We\nalso provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful\nfor estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive\nsimulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with\ncomparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step\ndenoising.

However, the\nexisting work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole\nlearning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits\nthe robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we\nintroduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous\ndriving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance\nmulti-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model\nbased on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its\ndiversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the\nend-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance\nthe optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative\nmodeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate\ninteractions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and\nNAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point\nimprovement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model.

A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to\nmimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to\ndevelop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,\nsuch systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the\nability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky\ncontrol systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for\ndesigning and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing\ndistributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines\n3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight\nactuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We\ndeveloped LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby\nachieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,\nwhich in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to\ncapitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:\none to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target\ndeformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits\nto achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots\nthat show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to\ntheir environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,\nuntethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new\ngeneration of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living\norganisms."}

We provide an overview of the\nhuman hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic\nhands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are\ncapable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement\nfor mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is\nmissing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?\n  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for\nrobotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist\nflexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation\ncapabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or\ndegrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise\nbetween simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two\nopposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase\ndexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum."}

We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to\nCollaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles\nthe common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative\nin formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete\ndifferent steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find\nsuccessful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes\ndecisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to\nformulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally\nallocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities\n(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's\nestimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the\nlow-level actions to perform or words to say to the human.
