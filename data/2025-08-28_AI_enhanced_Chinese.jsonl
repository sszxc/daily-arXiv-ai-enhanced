The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a\nmaximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second.

To address this challenge, we propose Greedy GuILD\nGrafting Trees (G3T*), a novel path planner that grafts invalid edge\nconnections at both ends to re-establish tree-based connectivity, enabling\nrapid path convergence.

As robots become integrated\ninto daily life, particularly in homes, the ability to anticipate and respond\nto environmental hazards is crucial for ensuring user safety, trust, and\neffective human-robot interaction. Our approach models object-level risk and\ncontext through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is\nrepresented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates\nasymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity\nand accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards\neven when they are not explicitly visible or labeled.

While recent USD methods have\nshown promise, their application to real-world robotics remains underexplored.\nIn this paper, we propose a modular USD framework to address the challenges in\nthe safety, interpretability, and deployability of the learned skills. Our\napproach employs user-defined factorization of the state space to learn\ndisentangled skill representations. It assigns different skill discovery\nalgorithms to each factor based on the desired intrinsic reward function. To\nencourage structured morphology-aware skills, we introduce symmetry-based\ninductive biases tailored to individual factors. We also incorporate a style\nfactor and regularization penalties to promote safe and robust behaviors. We\nevaluate our framework in simulation using a quadrupedal robot and demonstrate\nzero-shot transfer of the learned skills to real hardware. Our results show\nthat factorization and symmetry lead to the discovery of structured\nhuman-interpretable behaviors, while the style factor and penalties enhance\nsafety and diversity.
