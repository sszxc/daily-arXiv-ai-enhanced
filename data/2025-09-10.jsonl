Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend\nto be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an\nalternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A\ngenerator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,\nand a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the\nplanner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started\nwith the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing\nlower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple\ntrajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the\nthreshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a\nsuccessful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success\nlikelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a\nsuccessful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a\nframework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in\nparallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting\ntrajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To\nplan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a\nvectorized motion planner.

Addressing\nthe critical need of a robust control strategy for maintaining a desired\naltitude for the quadcopter to safe the hardware and the payload in physical\napplications. The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic\nProgramming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the\nchallenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a\nmodel-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high\ncomputational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid\ncomputation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge\narises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With\nmodifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were\ntrained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also\nachieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the\nrobustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were\nconducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and\nunderscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications. A\ncomparative analysis was performed between both RL algorithms and their\npotential for applications in faulty aerial systems."}

Featuring a central lifting surface that rotates in VTOL to generate\nvertical thrust and locks in forward flight to generate passive lift, the\nstop-rotor offers the potential for high efficiency across both modes. However,\npractical implementation has remained infeasible due to aerodynamic and\nstability conflicts between flight modes. In this work, we present SPERO\n(Stopped-Penta Rotor), a stop-rotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a\nflipping and latching wing, an active center of pressure mechanism, thrust\nvectored counterbalances, a five-rotor architecture, and an eleven-state\nmachine flight controller coordinating geometric and controller\nreconfiguration.

However, many existing variable stiffness\nsolutions rely on complex actuation schemes, continuous input power, or\nmonolithic designs, limiting their modularity and scalability. This paper\npresents the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC)-a modular, tendon-driven unit that\nachieves discrete stiffness modulation through mechanically interlocked joints\nactuated by cable tension. Each unit transitions between compliant and firm\nstates via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high\nstiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under\nhigh payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into\nreconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We\nvalidate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness\ngripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation;\nand (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves\nshape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These\nresults demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for\nprogrammable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable\nmorphology and task-adaptive interaction."}

Yet performance on contact-rich,\ndeformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,\neven with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency\nof existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.\nTo address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on\nhuman-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we\nfine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate\nrecovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human\noperators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot\nback to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective\nsegment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition\nexpands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,\nwhich we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on\nlong-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt\nhanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated\nassembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\\times$ less\ndata collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time\nscaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the\nnumber of recovery maneuvers it exhibits.

To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that\nenables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution\ndirectly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an\ninformation-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively\nhighlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues\nare structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently\nintegrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical\nbehavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance\nefficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy\nthat autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit\ngeometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly\nbenchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial\ngeneralization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation\nachieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the\nlanguage-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When\ndeployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89%\nplacement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking,\nletter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong\ngeneralization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations."}

However, current\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle\nphysical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to\nbridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating\ntorque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate\nseveral strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque\nadapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the\nencoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in\nautonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which\nfurther improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a\nphysically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation\nbenchmarks validate our findings."}
