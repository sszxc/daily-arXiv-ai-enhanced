However, significant challenges arise when implementing\npath velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.\nThe primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory\nplanning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves\nmaintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,\nparticularly at gear shifting points (GSP).

The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time\nefficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance\nframework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned\ntrajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal\nsmoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the\nproposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path\nadheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to\nmaintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility\nof the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time\nefficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other\niteration-based trajectory planning methods.

Project page:\n  https://gaussian-world-model.github.io/", "summary": "Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the\ninefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world\nmodels and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric\ninformation that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the\nthree-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To\nthis end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model\n(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by\ninferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot\nactions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D\nvariational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state\nreconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual\nrepresentation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future\nprediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports\nmodel-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments\ndepict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse\nrobot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform\nthe state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling\npotential of 3D world model."}

We hypothesized that real-time, rather\nthan post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce\nerrors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the\nring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the\nimpact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three\ngroups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and\n(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on\nthe accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who\nreceived real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation.\nAdditionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed\nparticipants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during\nlong, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between\ngroups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time\nfeedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved\npath sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error\nfeedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error\nfeedback in replay or no error feedback at all.
