The aim of the ROBSO-PM\nproject is to improve the accessibility of small museums through the use of\nsocial robots and social telepresence robots, focusing on three museums as case\nstudies: the Museum of the Holy Shroud in Turin, a small but globally known\ninstitution, and two lesser known mountain museums: the Museum of the Champlas\ndu Col Carnival and the Pragelato Museum of Alpine Peoples' Costumes and\nTraditions. The project explores two main applications for robots: as guides\nsupporting inclusive visits for foreign or disabled visitors, and as\ntelepresence tools allowing people with limited mobility to access museums\nremotely. From a research perspective, key topics include storytelling, robot\npersonality, empathy, personalization, and, in the case of telepresence,\ncollaboration between the robot and the person, with clearly defined roles and\nautonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "ROBSO-PM\u9879\u76ee\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u535a\u7269\u9986\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u578b\u535a\u7269\u9986\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6587\u5316\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u7a00\u5c11\u5730\u533a\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u89c8\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\u53d9\u4e8b\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2a\u6027\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u9879\u76ee\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bfc\u89c8\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u4eba\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u535a\u7269\u9986\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u652f\u6301\u5916\u56fd\u6e38\u5ba2\u3001\u6b8b\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u4e0d\u4fbf\u8005\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on\nreaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,\nthe learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching.

In\nthis paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account\nfor mixed datasets.

In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this\nlimited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the\ninherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically\ncomposed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied\nenvironments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into\ndataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios\nwhere acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that\ncarefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce\nshortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving\ngeneralization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\\pi_0$, in\nboth simulation and real-world environments.
