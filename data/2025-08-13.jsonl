Successfully\nperforming these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying\nphysics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during\nexecution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high\ndegree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,\nwhich makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical\nworkarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,\nneither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true\nrobotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising\ntrajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching\nmodel abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including\nconstraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of\nmotion of the articulated rigid body model. A review of underlying modeling and\ncontrol methods is given, followed by implementation details including model\nabstraction, trajectory optimization and whole-body controller.

However, such exploration is\ninherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,\nexpert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit\ngeneralizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration\n(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering\neffort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a\ndiverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate\nthe level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization\nprocess that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate\nthat SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors\nincluding crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as\njumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real\nhardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world."}

Robots, in contrast, often\nrequire hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the\ntraining conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to\nrecover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that\nthese explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of\nhigh-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this\nwork, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring\nthese latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR\nframes few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language\nmodel iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a\nplanner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the\nobserved demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over\nconcise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous\nmanipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across\nvariations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one\ndemonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel\nsettings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines."}

These repetitive,\nlabor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using\nlarge hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this\nwork, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of\nlarge-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules\nfor environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and\nmotion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement\nlearning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping\nlocations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the\nnumber of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses\nthe precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in\nmovement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material\nthrough dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world\nexperiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing\non two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck\nloading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the\nsystem's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational\nsafety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete automation of\nmaterial handling tasks on a full scale."}

In this paper, we present GeoVLA, a novel\nVLA framework that effectively integrates 3D information to advance robotic\nmanipulation. It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process images and\nlanguage instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings. In parallel,\nit converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized point\nencoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric embeddings\nindependently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and processed by\nour proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced Action Expert,\nwhich combines information from different sensor modalities to produce precise\naction sequences. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and\nreal-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior performance and\nrobustness.
