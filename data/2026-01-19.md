Result: Reduced energy consumption by up to 35% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance; robust performance under external disturbances in simulations and real-world experiments on modified Unitree Go1.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively optimizes omnidirectional locomotion efficiency for wheeled quadrupedal robots, validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the versatility of legs, but face significant energy optimization challenges when navigating diverse environments. In this work, we present a hierarchical control framework that integrates predictive power modeling with residual reinforcement learning to optimize omnidirectional locomotion efficiency for wheeled quadrupedal robots. Our approach employs a novel power prediction network that forecasts energy consumption across different gait patterns over a 1-second horizon, enabling intelligent selection of the most energy-efficient nominal gait. A reinforcement learning policy then generates residual adjustments to this nominal gait, fine-tuning the robot's actions to balance energy efficiency with performance objectives. Comparative analysis shows our method reduces energy consumption by up to 35\% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a modified Unitree Go1 platform, demonstrating robust performance even under external disturbances.

### [4] [Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for Vehicle Platoons with State-Dependent Friction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10724)
*Rishabh Dev Yadav*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons to handle unknown and complex frictional forces, external disturbances, and uncertain system parameters, involving a two-stage process (kinematic controller for desired velocities and dynamics model for motion commands) to maintain formation by regulating speed and predefined inter-robot distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of dealing with unknown/uncertain friction forces (varying with road surface, tire wear, and vehicle speed) in multi-robot formation control, as state-of-the-art adaptive controllers struggle with accurately modeling and identifying these state-dependent, a priori unbounded frictional forces.

Method: The method is a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons, which uses adaptive sliding mode control techniques and involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; second, the dynamics model generates commands to achieve the desired motion, separating kinematics and dynamics to simplify the control problem.

Result: The result is that the proposed controller can handle unknown and complex frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures, and regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed adaptive sliding mode controller with a two-stage (kinematics-dynamics separation) approach enables efficient and robust control of wheeled mobile robot platoons, effectively addressing the challenge of unknown/uncertain frictional forces and maintaining formation under disturbances and parameter uncertainties.

Abstract: Multi-robot formation control has various applications in domains such as vehicle troops, platoons, payload transportation, and surveillance. Maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon requires designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters while maintaining a predefined safe distance between the robots. A crucial challenge in this context is dealing with the unknown/uncertain friction forces between wheels and the ground, which vary with changes in road surface, wear in tires, and speed of the vehicle. Although state-of-the-art adaptive controllers can handle a priori bounded uncertainties, they struggle with accurately modeling and identifying frictional forces, which are often state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded.
  This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons that can handle the unknown and complex behavior of frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures. The controller uses the adaptive sliding mode control techniques to regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance, even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This approach involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates the desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; and second, the dynamics model generates the commands to achieve the desired motion. By separating the kinematics and dynamics of the robot, this approach can simplify the control problem and allow for more efficient and robust control of the wheeled mobile robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a diffusion-based planner for leader-follower formation control in cluttered environments, using diffusion policy to generate leaders' midpoint trajectory and a distance-constrained controller for followers, with smooth motions, low tracking errors, and failures mainly in narrow spaces or untrained obstacle configurations, validated by simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address leader-follower formation control in cluttered environments, requiring smooth motion generation and reliable formation maintenance.

Method: 1. Diffusion policy generates the trajectory of the midpoint of two leaders (modeled as a rigid bar in the plane) to define their desired motion paths; 2. Followers track leaders and maintain formation geometry via a distance-constrained controller based on relative positions in their local coordinates.

Result: The approach produces smooth motions and low tracking errors; failures occur primarily in narrow obstacle-free spaces or obstacle configurations not in the training dataset.

Conclusion: Simulation results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models for reliable multi-agent formation planning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based planner for leader--follower formation control in cluttered environments. The diffusion policy is used to generate the trajectory of the midpoint of two leaders as a rigid bar in the plane, thereby defining their desired motion paths in a planar formation. While the followers track the leaders and form desired foramtion geometry using a distance-constrained formation controller based only on the relative positions in followers' local coordinates. The proposed approach produces smooth motions and low tracking errors, with most failures occurring in narrow obstacle-free space, or obstacle configurations that are not in the training data set. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models for reliable multi-agent formation planning.

### [6] [Bidirectional Human-Robot Communication for Physical Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10796)
*Junxiang Wang,Cindy Wang,Rana Soltani Zarrin,Zackory Erickson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces BRIDGE, a bidirectional human-robot communication system for physical assistance that enables users to modify a robot's planned trajectory (position, velocity, force) in real time via natural language, using an LLM to interpret commands and providing verbal feedback, with user study results showing improved interactivity and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective physical human-robot interaction requires adaptability to user preferences and transparency about robot actions.

Method: BRIDGE system: users modify robot's trajectory (position, velocity, force) in real time using natural language; LLM interprets trajectory modifications from user commands considering planned motion and conversation history; provides verbal feedback (assuring changes or clarifying questions).

Result: User study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks comparing BRIDGE to ablation (without verbal feedback) and baseline: participants successfully modified trajectories in real time; bidirectional feedback led to significantly higher interactivity and transparency ratings.

Conclusion: Robot's verbal response is critical for a more intuitive user experience, enhancing interactivity and transparency in physical human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Effective physical human-robot interaction requires systems that are not only adaptable to user preferences but also transparent about their actions. This paper introduces BRIDGE, a system for bidirectional human-robot communication in physical assistance. Our method allows users to modify a robot's planned trajectory -- position, velocity, and force -- in real time using natural language. We utilize a large language model (LLM) to interpret any trajectory modifications implied by user commands in the context of the planned motion and conversation history. Importantly, our system provides verbal feedback in response to the user, either assuring any resulting changes or posing a clarifying question. We evaluated our method in a user study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks, comparing BRIDGE to an ablation without verbal feedback and a baseline. Results show that participants successfully used the system to modify trajectories in real time. Moreover, the bidirectional feedback led to significantly higher ratings of interactivity and transparency, demonstrating that the robot's verbal response is critical for a more intuitive user experience.

### [7] [SurfSLAM: Sim-to-Real Underwater Stereo Reconstruction For Real-Time SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10814)
*Onur Bagoren,Seth Isaacson,Sacchin Sundar,Yung-Ching Sun,Anja Sheppard,Haoyu Ma,Abrar Shariff,Ram Vasudevan,Katherine A. Skinner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in underwater stereo depth estimation and SLAM by proposing a sim-to-real training framework for disparity networks and a novel SLAM framework (\algname) fusing multi-sensor data, along with a real-world shipwreck dataset with 24k+ stereo pairs for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater stereo depth estimation is challenging due to image degradation (light attenuation, artifacts, dynamic lighting), lack of texture, poor transfer of land-trained networks, scarcity of real-world datasets, and compounded errors in stereo-based SLAM, hindering underwater robot perception.

Method: A novel framework enabling sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity networks (simulated data + self-supervised finetuning) and development of \algname, a real-time underwater SLAM fusing stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and DVL measurements; also collecting a real-world shipwreck dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed training approach improves stereo estimation in underwater domain and enables accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.

Conclusion: The proposed sim-to-real training framework, multi-sensor SLAM (\algname), and real-world dataset effectively address underwater stereo depth estimation and SLAM challenges, enhancing underwater robot perception capabilities.

Abstract: Localization and mapping are core perceptual capabilities for underwater robots. Stereo cameras provide a low-cost means of directly estimating metric depth to support these tasks. However, despite recent advances in stereo depth estimation on land, computing depth from image pairs in underwater scenes remains challenging. In underwater environments, images are degraded by light attenuation, visual artifacts, and dynamic lighting conditions. Furthermore, real-world underwater scenes frequently lack rich texture useful for stereo depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. As a result, stereo estimation networks trained on in-air data cannot transfer directly to the underwater domain. In addition, there is a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training of neural networks. Poor underwater depth estimation is compounded in stereo-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, making it a fundamental challenge for underwater robot perception. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enables sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning. We leverage our learned depth predictions to develop \algname, a novel framework for real-time underwater SLAM that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements. Lastly, we collect a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys using an underwater robot. Our dataset features over 24,000 stereo pairs, along with high-quality, dense photogrammetry models and reference trajectories for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed training approach on real-world data for improving stereo estimation in the underwater domain and for enabling accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.

### [8] [Approximately Optimal Global Planning for Contact-Rich SE(2) Manipulation on a Graph of Reachable Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10827)
*Simin Liu,Tong Zhao,Bernhard Paus Graesdal,Peter Werner,Jiuguang Wang,John Dolan,Changliu Liu,Tao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new paradigm for approximately optimal contact-rich manipulation (CRM) planning, which has offline graph construction of mutual reachable sets and online graph-based planning, outperforming a leading planner by reducing task cost 61%, achieving 91% success rate in 250 queries, and maintaining sub-minute query times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art model-based planners for contact-rich manipulation (CRM) focus on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting the exploitation of CRM's efficiency and naturalness advantages over end-effector-only manipulation.

Method: The approach has two phases: offline, construct a graph of mutual reachable sets (each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp); online, plan over this graph to compute and sequence local plans for globally optimized motion.

Result: On a challenging CRM task, the approach outperforms a leading planner by reducing task cost 61%, achieves 91% success rate across 250 queries, and maintains sub-minute query times.

Conclusion: Globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks.

Abstract: If we consider human manipulation, it is clear that contact-rich manipulation (CRM)-the ability to use any surface of the manipulator to make contact with objects-can be far more efficient and natural than relying solely on end-effectors (i.e., fingertips). However, state-of-the-art model-based planners for CRM are still focused on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit CRM's advantages. We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%. It also achieves a 91% success rate across 250 queries and maintains sub-minute query times, ultimately demonstrating that globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks.

### [9] [Is open robotics innovation a threat to international peace and security?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10877)
*Ludovic Righetti,Vincent Boulanin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper discusses the dual-use risks of open access in robotics, highlighting the lack of specific regulation, and proposes a roadmap with four practices for responsible research and innovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open access in robotics lowers entry barriers and supports reproducible science but exacerbates dual-use risks, while robotics lacks specific regulation and guidance compared to other fields with dual-use risks.

Method: The paper analyzes the dual-use risks of open access in robotics, compares it with other fields, and proposes a roadmap focusing on four practices.

Result: A roadmap with four practices is proposed: education in responsible robotics, incentivizing risk assessment, moderating diffusion of high-risk material, and developing red lines.

Conclusion: The robotics community should work toward sector-specific guidance and possibly regulation through the proposed roadmap to address dual-use risks of open access.

Abstract: Open access to publication, software and hardware is central to robotics: it lowers barriers to entry, supports reproducible science and accelerates reliable system development. However, openness also exacerbates the inherent dual-use risks associated with research and innovation in robotics. It lowers barriers for states and non-state actors to develop and deploy robotics systems for military use and harmful purposes. Compared to other fields of engineering where dual-use risks are present - e.g., those that underlie the development of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons) and even the field of AI, robotics offers no specific regulation and little guidance as to how research and innovation may be conducted and disseminated responsibly. While other fields can be used for guidance, robotics has its own needs and specificities which have to be taken into account. The robotics community should therefore work toward its own set of sector-specific guidance and possibly regulation. To that end, we propose a roadmap focusing on four practices: a) education in responsible robotics; b) incentivizing risk assessment; c) moderating the diffusion of high-risk material; and d) developing red lines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究针对接触丰富的灵巧操作挑战，提出一种层次化RL-MPC框架，通过高层RL策略预测接触意图（物体表面接触位置和接触后物体子目标姿态），低层接触隐式MPC优化接触模式并生成动作，在非抓握任务（如几何泛化推和物体3D重定向）上实现近100%成功率，数据需求减少10倍，鲁棒性强且零样本从仿真到现实迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端视觉运动策略存在数据需求量大、仿真到现实迁移差、跨任务/载体泛化弱的问题，而灵巧操作具有内在的层次性，需联合推理几何、运动学约束和复杂非光滑接触动力学。

Method: 提出层次化RL-MPC框架：高层强化学习（RL）策略预测接触意图（包括物体表面接触位置和接触后物体级子目标姿态）；低层基于该接触意图，通过接触隐式模型预测控制（MPC）优化局部接触模式，并结合接触动力学重新规划以生成机器人动作。

Result: 在非抓握任务（几何泛化推和物体3D重定向）上实现近100%的成功率，数据需求量比端到端基线减少10倍，表现出高度鲁棒的性能，并实现零样本的仿真到现实迁移。

Conclusion: 该层次化RL-MPC框架通过利用灵巧操作的层次特性，有效解决了端到端方法的局限性，在非抓握任务中展现出优异的性能、数据效率、鲁棒性和迁移能力。

Abstract: A key challenge in contact-rich dexterous manipulation is the need to jointly reason over geometry, kinematic constraints, and intricate, nonsmooth contact dynamics. End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. It achieves near-100% success with substantially reduced data (10x less than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

### [11] [Crane Lowering Guidance Using a Attachable Camera Module for Driver Vision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11026)
*HyoJae Kang,SunWoo Ahn,InGyu Choi,GeonYeong Go,KunWoo Son,Min-Sung Kang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study proposes an attachable camera module for cranes to address the load obstructing the operator's view during the lowering phase, aiming to improve construction site safety by providing real-time visual guidance of the landing point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: During the lowering phase of crane operation, the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point, forcing operators to rely on verbal/gestural instructions from ground personnel, which impacts site safety.

Method: An attachable camera module with a suction cup, containing a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera, is designed to be attached to the load. It streams and processes real-time images of the ground below the load to generate installation guidance, which is transmitted to a host computer for monitoring.

Result: Preliminary experiments confirmed the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission when the module was attached to a test object.

Conclusion: This approach has the potential to significantly improve construction site safety by providing crane operators with an instant visual reference of hidden landing zones.

Abstract: Cranes have long been essential equipment for lifting and placing heavy loads in construction projects. This study focuses on the lowering phase of crane operation, the stage in which the load is moved to the desired location. During this phase, a constant challenge exists: the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point. As a result, operators traditionally have to rely on verbal or gestural instructions from ground personnel, which significantly impacts site safety. To alleviate this constraint, the proposed system incorporates a attachable camera module designed to be attached directly to the load via a suction cup. This module houses a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. After installation, it streams and processes images of the ground directly below the load in real time to generate installation guidance. Simultaneously, this guidance is transmitted to and monitored by a host computer. Preliminary experiments were conducted by attaching this module to a test object, confirming the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission. This approach has the potential to significantly improve safety on construction sites by providing crane operators with an instant visual reference of hidden landing zones.

*Haishan Zeng,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework H-AIM to address the challenge of heterogeneous robot teams executing long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions, achieving significant performance improvements on the MACE-THOR benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling heterogeneous robot teams to execute long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions is a critical challenge in embodied AI, and LLMs have limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination.

Method: H-AIM uses a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) LLM parses instructions to generate PDDL problem descriptions; 2) combines LLM semantic reasoning with classical planner search to produce optimized action sequences; 3) compiles the plan into behavior trees for reactive control, with a shared blackboard for communication and state synchronization.

Result: Experimental results on the MACE-THOR benchmark (42 tasks, 8 household layouts) show H-AIM elevates task success rate from 12% to 55% and goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the baseline LaMMA-P.

Conclusion: H-AIM effectively addresses the limitations of LLMs in long-term reasoning and multi-robot coordination, significantly improving the performance of heterogeneous robot teams in executing long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: In embodied artificial intelligence, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to execute long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions remains a critical challenge. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that H-AIM achieves a remarkable performance improvement, elevating the task success rate from 12% to 55% and boosting the goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the strongest baseline, LaMMA-P.

Motivation: Furniture assembly is a challenging task for robots requiring precise dual-arm coordination, and robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process while generalizing across diverse part geometries.

Method: A3D employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns for generalization across varied geometries, and introduces an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the framework generalizes effectively to diverse part geometries and furniture categories in both simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed A3D framework effectively addresses the challenges of dual-arm furniture assembly by enabling adaptive support strategies and generalization across diverse part geometries, as validated by experiments in simulation and real-world environments.

Abstract: Furniture assembly is a crucial yet challenging task for robots, requiring precise dual-arm coordination where one arm manipulates parts while the other provides collaborative support and stabilization. To accomplish this task more effectively, robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process, while also generalizing across diverse part geometries. We propose A3D, a framework which learns adaptive affordances to identify optimal support and stabilization locations on furniture parts. The method employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns, enabling generalization across varied geometries. To handle evolving assembly states, we introduce an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions. We establish a simulation environment featuring 50 diverse parts across 8 furniture types, designed for dual-arm collaboration evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generalizes effectively to diverse part geometries and furniture categories in both simulation and real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most marker-based landing approaches assume idealized visibility and sensor performance, limiting robustness in complex urban settings, so there is a need to evaluate under diverse, realistic operational conditions.

Method: A simulation-based evaluation suite on AirSim with systematically varied urban layouts, lighting, and weather; using onboard RGB and depth cameras to benchmark two heuristic coverage patterns and a reinforcement learning-based agent, analyzing exploration strategy and scene complexity impacts.

Conclusion: Evaluating marker-based autonomous landing under diverse, sensor-relevant conditions is crucial for developing reliable aerial navigation systems.

Abstract: Marker-based landing is widely used in drone delivery and return-to-base systems for its simplicity and reliability. However, most approaches assume idealized landing site visibility and sensor performance, limiting robustness in complex urban settings. We present a simulation-based evaluation suite on the AirSim platform with systematically varied urban layouts, lighting, and weather to replicate realistic operational diversity. Using onboard camera sensors (RGB for marker detection and depth for obstacle avoidance), we benchmark two heuristic coverage patterns and a reinforcement learning-based agent, analyzing how exploration strategy and scene complexity affect success rate, path efficiency, and robustness. Results underscore the need to evaluate marker-based autonomous landing under diverse, sensor-relevant conditions to guide the development of reliable aerial navigation systems.

*Minho Lee,Hyeonseok Kim,Jin Tak Kim,Sangshin Park,Jeong Hyun Lee,Jungsan Cho,Jemin Hwangbo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the sim-to-real transfer challenge of large-scale hydraulic robots by proposing an analytical actuator model based on hydraulic dynamics, which enables rapid joint torque prediction (under 1 microsecond for 12 actuators), outperforms neural network-based models in data-limited scenarios, and successfully transfers a stable RL-trained locomotion policy to a 300+ kg hydraulic quadruped robot, marking the first such demonstration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sim-to-real transfer of large-scale hydraulic robots is challenging due to slow control response, complex fluid dynamics from multiple interconnected cylinders and differing fluid rates, which complicates detailed joint simulation and makes it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications.

Method: An analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics is proposed to represent complicated actuators, predicting joint torques for 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond to enable rapid processing in RL environments.

Result: The proposed model outperforms neural network-based actuator models in data-limited scenarios, and the RL-trained locomotion policy using this model is successfully deployed on a 300+ kg hydraulic quadruped robot.

Conclusion: This work is the first demonstration of successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.

Abstract: The simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer of large-scale hydraulic robots presents a significant challenge in robotics because of the inherent slow control response and complex fluid dynamics. The complex dynamics result from the multiple interconnected cylinder structure and the difference in fluid rates of the cylinders. These characteristics complicate detailed simulation for all joints, making it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent the complicated actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, allowing rapid processing in RL environments. We compare our model with neural network-based actuator models and demonstrate the advantages of our model in data-limited scenarios. The locomotion policy trained in RL with our model is deployed on a hydraulic quadruped robot, which is over 300 kg. This work is the first demonstration of a successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.

*Savvas Papaioannou,Panayiotis Kolios,Christos G. Panayiotou,Marios M. Polycarpou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of adaptively monitoring a wildfire front using a mobile agent (e.g., a drone), formulating it as a stochastic optimal control problem integrating sensing, estimation, and control. It derives an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models and transforms the control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process, designing an information-seeking predictive control law via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for wildfire front monitoring often treat sensing, estimation, and control separately, with state-of-the-art approaches either relying on linear-Gaussian assumptions for optimality or using approximations/heuristics without explicit performance guarantees, failing to handle the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution.

Method: The fire front monitoring task is formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem integrating sensing, estimation, and control. An optimal recursive Bayesian estimator is derived for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. The nonlinear stochastic control problem is transformed into a finite-horizon Markov decision process, and an information-seeking predictive control law is designed via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.

Result: Not explicitly provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Not explicitly provided in the abstract.

Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptively monitoring a wildfire front using a mobile agent (e.g., a drone), whose trajectory determines where sensor data is collected and thus influences the accuracy of fire propagation estimation. This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. Subsequently, we transform the resulting nonlinear stochastic control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process and design an information-seeking predictive control law obtained via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces VLAgents, a modular policy server with a unified Gymnasium-style protocol to address deployment complexity of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in robotics, featuring a context-adaptive communication layer (zero-copy shared memory for simulation, compressed streaming for remote hardware), integrates seven policies, and outperforms default servers (OpenVLA, OpenPi, LeRobot) in local/remote benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA model deployment in robotics is complex due to fragmented interfaces and communication latency in distributed setups.

Method: Introduce VLAgents, a modular policy server abstracting VLA inferencing with a unified Gymnasium-style protocol, and a communication layer that adapts context (zero-copy shared memory for high-speed simulation, compressed streaming for remote hardware).

Result: Integrated seven policies (including OpenVLA and Pi Zero) and outperformed default policy servers (OpenVLA, OpenPi, LeRobot) in local and remote communication benchmarks.

Conclusion: VLAgents effectively addresses VLA deployment complexity via modular architecture and context-adaptive communication, validated through policy integration and benchmark superiority.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) has a significant impact on robotics. However, their deployment remains complex due to the fragmented interfaces and the inherent communication latency in distributed setups. To address this, we introduce VLAgents, a modular policy server that abstracts VLA inferencing behind a unified Gymnasium-style protocol. Crucially, its communication layer transparently adapts to the context by supporting both zero-copy shared memory for high-speed simulation and compressed streaming for remote hardware. In this work, we present the architecture of VLAgents and validate it by integrating seven policies -- including OpenVLA and Pi Zero. In a benchmark with both local and remote communication, we further demonstrate how it outperforms the default policy servers provided by OpenVLA, OpenPi, and LeRobot.

*Aoshen Huang,Jiaming Chen,Jiyu Cheng,Ran Song,Wei Pan,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff) to enhance robust generalization in robotic manipulation by incorporating skill-level information, introduces the IsaacSkill dataset, and demonstrates improved performance in simulation and real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods improve generalization by scaling data and networks but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information, while tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns.

Method: SADiff learns skill-specific representations via a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow, and uses a skill-retrieval transformation strategy to refine 2D-to-3D action mapping; also introduces the IsaacSkill dataset.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating skill-level information through SADiff and using the IsaacSkill dataset effectively improves robust generalization in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Robust generalization in robotic manipulation is crucial for robots to adapt flexibly to diverse environments. Existing methods usually improve generalization by scaling data and networks, but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information. Observing that tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns, we propose Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff), which explicitly incorporates skill-level information to improve generalization. SADiff learns skill-specific representations through a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, and conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow. A skill-retrieval transformation strategy further exploits skill-specific trajectory priors to refine the mapping from 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions. Furthermore, we introduce IsaacSkill, a high-fidelity dataset containing fundamental robotic skills for comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

*Tyler Paine,Brendan Long,Jeremy Wenger,Michael DeFilippo,James Usevitch,Michael Benjamin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a pragmatic approach using a distributed safety control filter based on control barrier function (CBF) theory to address collision avoidance challenges in heterogeneous uncrewed vessel fleets, comparing it with COLREGS behavior-based approach in simulations and real-world experiments, and finding combining both achieves best safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous uncrewed vessel fleets face collision avoidance challenges due to differing decision-making processes and controllers between platforms, and limitations on real-time sharing of trajectories and control values.

Method: Developing a distributed safety control filter using control barrier function (CBF) theory that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts (including crewed vessels), with clear description for explainability; comparing with Collision Regulations (COLREGS) behavior-based approach in simulated encounters and conducting real-world experiments with three uncrewed vessels and a human-operated vessel.

Result: Combining CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors achieves the best safety and efficiency; the approach is effective across a range of platforms and robust to uncooperative human operator behavior.

Conclusion: The pragmatic approach with the distributed CBF-based control filter, when combined with COLREGS behaviors, effectively addresses collision avoidance challenges in heterogeneous uncrewed vessel fleets, showing good safety, efficiency, platform adaptability, and robustness to uncooperative behavior.

Abstract: Collision avoidance in heterogeneous fleets of uncrewed vessels is challenging because the decision-making processes and controllers often differ between platforms, and it is further complicated by the limitations on sharing trajectories and control values in real-time. This paper presents a pragmatic approach that addresses these issues by adding a control filter on each autonomous vehicle that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts, including crewed vessels. This distributed safety control filter is developed using control barrier function (CBF) theory and the application is clearly described to ensure explainability of these safety-critical methods. This work compares the worst-case CBF approach with a Collision Regulations (COLREGS) behavior-based approach in simulated encounters. Real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human operated vessel were performed to confirm the approach is effective across a range of platforms and is robust to uncooperative behavior from human operators. Results show that combining both CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors achieves the best safety and efficiency.

Conclusion: ACoT范式及ACoT-VLA架构通过直接在动作空间推理，有效提升了VLA模型的精确动作执行能力，实验验证其优越性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.

Conclusion: GM-100为机器人学习评估提供多样化、挑战性任务集，推动领域数据集任务设计发展。

Abstract: Recently, with the rapid development of robot learning and imitation learning, numerous datasets and methods have emerged. However, these datasets and their task designs often lack systematic consideration and principles. This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models. Our data and code are available at https://rhos.ai/research/gm-100.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semantic-geometric task graph representation and a learning framework combining MPNN encoder and Transformer decoder to learn structured task representations from human demonstrations, addressing challenges in capturing discrete semantic structure and temporal geometric relations of long-horizon bimanual manipulation tasks, with evaluations showing benefits for high-variability tasks and transferability to physical robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To jointly capture the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression for long-horizon bimanual manipulation behaviors where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry vary significantly.

Method: Proposes a learning framework combining a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder and a Transformer-based decoder; the encoder operates on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons.

Result: Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, shows that semantic-geometric task graph representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.

Abstract: Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.
