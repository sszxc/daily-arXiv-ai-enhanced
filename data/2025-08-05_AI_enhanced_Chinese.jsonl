Using\nautonomous social navigation as a motivating application, we demonstrate that\nour approach can flexibly adapt to dynamic environments to satisfy safety\nrequirements in real-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210-\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08CFM\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\uff08MPPI\uff09\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684CFM\u6a21\u578b\u548cMPPI\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\uff1aCFM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cMPPI\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u53cd\u9988\u7ed9CFM\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u793e\u4ea4\u5bfc\u822a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u5b9e\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train\nan outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers\nthat utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,\ninter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents\ncommunicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high\nscalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs\nduring inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,\nwe introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration\nand body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,\nenables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused\nby cable tension during dynamic 3D motion.

While existing studies have\nfocused on automated endoscopic insertion, the automation of NTI remains\nunexplored despite its unique challenges: Nasotracheal tubes exhibit greater\ndiameter and rigidity than standard endoscopes, substantially increasing\ninsertion complexity and patient risks. We propose a novel autonomous NTI\nsystem with two key components to address these challenges. First, an\nautonomous NTI system is developed, incorporating a prosthesis embedded with\nforce sensors, allowing for safety assessment and data filtering. Then, the\nRecurrent Action-Confidence Chunking with Transformer (RACCT) model is\ndeveloped to handle complex tube-tissue interactions and partial visual\nobservations. Experimental results demonstrate that the RACCT model outperforms\nthe ACT model in all aspects and achieves a 66% reduction in average peak\ninsertion force compared to manual operations while maintaining equivalent\nsuccess rates.

It extends our prior work presented at Robotics:\n  Science and Systems (RSS) 2024, with a new compositional program induction\n  pipeline from natural language, and expanded evaluations on personalized\n  bookshelf and bedroom furniture layout tasks", "summary": "Functional object arrangement (FORM) is the task of arranging objects to\nfulfill a function, e.g., \"set up a dining table for two\". One key challenge\nhere is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not\nexplicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,\na neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects\nfrom a few training examples and a structured natural-language task\nspecification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract\nspatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate\nrepresentation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)\npredicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the\ngrounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to\ninduce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.\nThis program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.\nFor (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture\nprimitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object\nposes based on the grounding graph.

Such manipulation requires both\neffectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and\nefficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions.\nExisting approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods\nrelying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering\nstructural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust\nmanipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through\nreactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces\nTacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated\nobject manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off.

The system model is considered to have uncertain model\nparameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update\nthe model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic\nestimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error\nreduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives\ngenerated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model\nselected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also\nequipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal\nestimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall\nmotion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the\nsize of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter.

To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the\ncomplexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware\ncoordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot\ntarget tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our\napproach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)\nprobabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent\nsensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding\ninferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or\ncommunication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized\nbehavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned\ninto subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and\ncollaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots\nexperiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate\nindependently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them\nto contribute to the task within their local context.

We\nvalidate our approach in real orchard environments with a custom-built\nquadrotor platform. Field experiments demonstrate that after only a few\niterations of training, the proposed VAE-based controller can autonomously\nnavigate the UAV based on a front-mounted camera stream. The controller\nexhibits strong obstacle avoidance performance, achieves longer flying\ndistances with less human assistance, and outperforms existing algorithms.\nFurthermore, we show that the policy generalizes effectively to novel\nenvironments and maintains competitive performance across varying conditions\nand speeds.

In this work, we\nintroduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that\nsystematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual\nmonitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for\nembodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system\nfirst decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program\ngrounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed\nin simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected\ncheckpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure\nreasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events\nwith VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and\nrepairs programs.
