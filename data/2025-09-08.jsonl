The framework enables rapid\nadaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target\ndomains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only\nlimited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain\nskill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a\ndomain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an\noffline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The\nprototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of\nlong-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains.\nFurthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a\ndynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter\ntoward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with\nrobotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that\nour $\\oursol$ framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under\nlimited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations\nincluding differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task\nhorizon."}

Building on our earlier Surformer v1\nframework [1], which employed handcrafted feature extraction followed by\nmid-level fusion architecture with multi-head cross-attention layers, Surformer\nv2 integrates the feature extraction process within the model itself and shifts\nto late fusion.

We evaluate Surformer v2 on the Touch and Go dataset [2], a\nmulti-modal benchmark comprising surface images and corresponding tactile\nsensor readings.
