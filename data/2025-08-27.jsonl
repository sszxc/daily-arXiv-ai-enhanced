However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual\ntimestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our\nresults demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the\nbaseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal\nachieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate\nby nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear\ntrade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while\nscenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that\nintelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and\nreliable autonomous agents."}

Traditional methods for\ngenerating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting\nrobots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and\nsafety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging\nvisual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a\ntraversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach\nnot only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated\nwith real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of\nadvanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.\nTo support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled\nindoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our\nmethod provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art\nmethods, constantly reaching the final goal."}

This structured function class aligns the\nstate-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving\nsample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing\ninterpretable posture-action sensitivities.

Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even\nand uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate\nthat QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer\ncollisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Popular path planning\nalgorithms, such as Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), employ effort heuristics to\nguide the search. Effective heuristics are accurate and computationally\nefficient, but achieving both can be challenging due to their conflicting\nnature. This paper proposes Direction Informed Trees (DIT*), a sampling-based\nplanner that focuses on optimizing the search direction for each edge,\nresulting in goal bias during exploration. We define edges as generalized\nvectors and integrate similarity indexes to establish a directional filter that\nselects the nearest neighbors and estimates direction costs. The estimated\ndirection cost heuristics are utilized in edge evaluation. This strategy allows\nthe exploration to share directional information efficiently.

Cognitive science\nsuggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived\nrepresentations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves\nverbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term\nmemory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a\nCognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A\npretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens\nthat form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores\nlow-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory\nretrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with\ncurrent tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these\ntokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware\naction sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks\nacross three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it\nachieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on\nBridge.
