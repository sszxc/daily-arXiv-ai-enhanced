The modular design allows parallel processing and reproducible\nhandling of samples, reducing experimental time and increasing consistency.\nCompression testing is introduced as a sensitive mechanical characterization\nmethod for estimating membrane stiffness and as a proxy to infer porosity and\nintra-sample uniformity through automated analysis of stress-strain curves. As\na proof of concept to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, NIPS was\ncarried out with polysulfone, the green solvent PolarClean, and water as the\npolymer, solvent, and nonsolvent, respectively.

We argue that planning failures are\nprimarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such\nfailures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To\naddress this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,\nusing it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than\nperforming blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to\nidentify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are\nprimarily responsible for the planning failures.

However, current UGV datasets fall short in meeting the demands\nfor advancing navigation and mapping techniques due to limitations in sensor\nconfiguration, time synchronization, ground truth, and scenario diversity. To\naddress these challenges, we present i2Nav-Robot, a large-scale dataset\ndesigned for multi-sensor fusion navigation and mapping in indoor-outdoor\nenvironments. We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view\nand 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras,\nodometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial\nmeasurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate\ntimestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and\noffline calibration for all sensors. The dataset comprises ten larger-scale\nsequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets,\nand indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters.\nHigh-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is\nderived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a\nnavigation-grade IMU. The proposed i2Nav-Robot dataset is evaluated by more\nthan ten open-sourced multi-sensor fusion systems, and it has proven to have\nsuperior data quality."}

Existing methods\nencode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian\ncoordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and\nsurrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does\nnot naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on\ntheir relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt\nthe Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and\nangle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model\nspatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and\ndirectional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel\nmethod that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from\nconventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar\nrepresentation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations\nand captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement\nmodules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and\nplanning.

Unlike structured driving environments, parking requires executing\ncomplex maneuvers such as frequent gear shifts and steering saturation. Recent\nattempts to employ imitation learning (IL) for parking have achieved promising\nresults. However, existing works ignore the multimodal nature of parking\nbehavior in lane-free open space, failing to derive multiple plausible\nsolutions under the same situation. Notably, IL-based methods encompass\ninherent causal confusion, so enabling a neural network to generalize across\ndiverse parking scenarios is particularly difficult. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MultiPark, an autoregressive transformer for multimodal\nparking. To handle paths filled with abrupt turning points, we introduce a\ndata-efficient next-segment prediction paradigm, enabling spatial\ngeneralization and temporal extrapolation. Furthermore, we design learnable\nparking queries factorized into gear, longitudinal, and lateral components,\nparallelly decoding diverse parking behaviors. To mitigate causal confusion in\nIL, our method employs target-centric pose and ego-centric collision as\noutcome-oriented loss across all modalities beyond pure imitation loss.\nEvaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that MultiPark achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. We deploy MultiPark on a\nproduction vehicle, further confirming our approach's robustness in real-world\nparking environments."}

It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to\n(i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii)\nto dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray\nnozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not\npossible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying\nand the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In\naddition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift,\nboom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of\nthis complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist.\nTherefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed\nsimpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching.\nThe comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is\nintrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic.\nCombinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as\nthree sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by\ncontrolling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with\nthe same control signal as one single section.
