A key concern is\nassuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe\ndecision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common\nenvironmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To\naddress this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)\nPerceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically\nanalyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations\nnegatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State\nTrees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model\nhow these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or\npose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to\nquantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote\nrigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust\nin autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for\nidentifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks."}

Cross"], "title": "A Multimodal Neural Network for Recognizing Subjective Self-Disclosure Towards Social Robots", "comment": "Accepted at 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent\n  Robots and Systems (IROS)", "summary": "Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social\ninteraction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature\nto characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,\nlittle work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are\nable to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to\nmodel specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.\nIt is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction\nwith and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In\nthis paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based\non models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a\nlarge self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss\nfunction, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both\nclassification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that\nthe best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1\nscore of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result\nmakes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an\ninteraction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in\nsocial robots with social cognition."}

Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation\naccuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade\nlocalization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two\nmain factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system\nobservability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to\nimproper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a\nconsistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system\nbased on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the\nsystem state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and\nenabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.\nFurthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant\nerror properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO\nalgorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,\nthereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and\nexperiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and\nconsistency compared to existing methods."}

Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific\nrequirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites\nand space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using\nthe Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital\nparameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By\nformulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom\nOpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using\nclassical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of\nthe orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right\nascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted\nterrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x\nhigher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer\ntimesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission\nobjectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational\nefficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key\ncontributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment\nincorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'\nsuperiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)\ndemonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This\napproach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient\nalternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning."}
