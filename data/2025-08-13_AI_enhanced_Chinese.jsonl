Successfully\nperforming these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying\nphysics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during\nexecution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high\ndegree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,\nwhich makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical\nworkarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,\nneither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true\nrobotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising\ntrajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching\nmodel abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including\nconstraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of\nmotion of the articulated rigid body model.

However, existing research has predominantly focused on\nstatic-object grasping, neglecting the challenges posed by dynamic targets and\nthus limiting applicability in dynamic scenarios such as logistics sorting and\nhuman-robot collaboration. To address this, we introduce DQ-Bench, a new\nbenchmark that systematically evaluates dynamic grasping across varying object\nmotions, velocities, heights, object types, and terrain complexities, along\nwith comprehensive evaluation metrics. Building upon this benchmark, we propose\nDQ-Net, a compact teacher-student framework designed to infer grasp\nconfigurations from limited perceptual cues.

This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR\n(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a\nphoto-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS\nmodel, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS\nmodel may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this\nend, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which\njointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or\nnot) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across\ndifferent frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO\nproblem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm\nthat reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional\nbranch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are\npresented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method\nachieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and\nlegged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios.
