This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,\ntransforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes\nwithin sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile\nsensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials\nor designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material\nfabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric\nmodel to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately\npredict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the\nfingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,\ndemonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile\nfeedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading\nconditions.

Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer\ncomputational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert\nknowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even\nwith careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired\ntrade-off.

In our framework, since RTG intuitively\nmeasures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require\nexpert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both\nstructured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency\ntrade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter.

We\nfocus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE\nformulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE\nintegrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in\notherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by\none degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator. Furthermore,\nrecognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we\npropose methods for searching for these separate SMM components. Our\nformulations and algorithms compute accurate SMM solutions without requiring\nadditional IK refinement, and we extend our methods to prismatic joint systems\n-- an area not covered in current SMM literature. This manuscript presents the\nderivation of these methods and several examples that show how the methods work\nand their limitations."}

However, the small size and fragility of retinal veins, coupled\nwith the need for high-precision, tremor-free needle manipulation, create\nsignificant technical challenges. These limitations highlight the need for\nrobotic assistance to improve accuracy and stability. This study presents an\nautomated robotic system with a top-down microscope and B-scan optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) imaging for precise depth sensing. Deep\nlearning-based models enable real-time needle navigation, contact detection,\nand vein puncture recognition, using a chicken embryo model as a surrogate for\nhuman retinal veins. The system autonomously detects needle position and\npuncture events with 85% accuracy. The experiments demonstrate notable\nreductions in navigation and puncture times compared to manual methods. Our\nresults demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced imaging and deep\nlearning to automate microsurgical tasks, providing a pathway for safer and\nmore reliable RVC procedures with enhanced precision and reproducibility."}

However, loco-manipulation tasks performed by legged robots\nintroduce additional complexity, necessitating computationally efficient MPC\nalgorithms capable of handling high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) models. This letter\npresents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored\nfor loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic\nmanipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the\nquadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples\nlocomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with\na full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control.\nThis decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in\na receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories\ngenerated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear\nwhole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque\ncommands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control\narchitecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware\nexperiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg\n4-DoF Kinova arm. Given that the Kinova arm dynamics are non-negligible\nrelative to the Go2 base, the proposed NMPC framework demonstrates robust\nstability in performing diverse loco-manipulation tasks, effectively handling\nexternal disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrain."}
