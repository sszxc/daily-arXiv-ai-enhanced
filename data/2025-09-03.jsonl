When it happens, deploying\nemergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human\nresponders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and\ndisaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete\nperception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To\nenhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire\nscenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire\nprevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency\nresponse documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph\n(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large\nMultimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs\nfrom real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide\ninterpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component\nconfiguration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and\nreal-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical\napplication value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making."}

Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing\ndatasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information\nrichness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a\nfine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban\nsignalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for\ndrone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection\ntypes, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000\nTPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts\nper minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides\ncomprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw\nvideos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements\nvalidates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification\nof motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of\ninteractive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining,\ntraffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research."}

One such approach to few-shot\nimitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts\nrelevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a\nlimited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior\ndatasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data\npoint's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.\nWhile retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data\nselection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel\ndensity (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution.

Our system supports teleoperation through three\nstructurally distinct 3D-printed leader arms that share consistent control\nlogic, enabling seamless compatibility with diverse commercial robot\nconfigurations. Compared with previous open-source leader-follower interfaces,\nwe further optimized both the mechanical design and servo selection, achieving\na bill of materials (BOM) cost of only \\$50.5 for the 6-DoF leader arm and\n\\$56.8 for the 7-DoF version. To enhance usability, we mitigate the common\nchallenge in controlling redundant degrees of freedom by %engineering methods\nmechanical and control optimizations. Experimental results demonstrate that\nU-Arm achieves 39\\% higher data collection efficiency and comparable task\nsuccess rates across multiple manipulation scenarios compared with Joycon,\nanother low-cost teleoperation interface. We have open-sourced all CAD models\nof three configs and also provided simulation support for validating\nteleoperation workflows. We also open-sourced real-world manipulation data\ncollected with U-Arm. The project website is\nhttps://github.com/MINT-SJTU/LeRobot-Anything-U-Arm."}

And with robotics\nsoftware often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor\nalterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or\ndeploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help\nsolve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for\nbuilding, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that\nmaximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying\nlow-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by\nintroducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process\nto semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without\nlimiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral\nin detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of\nincreasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion\nmitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software,\nCoral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system\nintegration challenges, improving component reusability, system\nreconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We\nrelease Coral open source."}

While VBTSs have common\ndesign features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity\nof sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data\ninterpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that\ncategorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the\nunderlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based\nTransduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.\nMarker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker\ndisplacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based\nTransduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.\nDepending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be\nfurther divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological\nMarker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction\nPrinciple encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent\nLayer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the\nhardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various\ncombination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting\ntactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by\nVBTS technology and directions for future research."}

In\ncontrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such\nas distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.\nSince such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth\ncameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual\ncapabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation\nis challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to\nvarious types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as\na simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth\nsignals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,\nwe develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from\nsimulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that\nCDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively\nbridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,\nwithout the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes\nseamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving\narticulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance\ndegradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing\nsimulation data and 3D information in general robot policies."}
