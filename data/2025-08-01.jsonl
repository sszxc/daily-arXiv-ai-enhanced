Traditional point\ncloud registration methods relying solely on offline maps often exhibit limited\nrobustness against long-term environmental changes, leading to localization\ndrift and reliability degradation in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address\nthese challenges, this paper proposes DuLoc, a robust and accurate localization\nmethod that tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based\nlocalization, incorporating a constant-velocity motion model to mitigate\noutlier noise in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a LiDAR-based\nlocalization framework that seamlessly integrates a prior global map with\ndynamic real-time local maps, enabling robust localization in unbounded and\nchanging environments. Extensive real-world experiments in ultra unbounded port\nthat involve 2,856 hours of operational data across 32 Intelligent Guided\nVehicles (IGVs) are conducted and reported in this study. The results attained\ndemonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR\nlocalization systems in large-scale changing outdoor environments."}

We present BGS-SLAM, the first binocular 3D Gaussian\nSplatting SLAM system designed for outdoor scenarios. Our approach uses only\nRGB stereo pairs without requiring LiDAR or active sensors. BGS-SLAM leverages\ndepth estimates from pre-trained deep stereo networks to guide 3D Gaussian\noptimization with a multi-loss strategy enhancing both geometric consistency\nand visual quality. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that BGS-SLAM\nachieves superior tracking accuracy and mapping performance compared to other\n3DGS-based solutions in complex outdoor environments."}

Recent work has begun to explore the\nincorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change\nbetween two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,\na novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent\naction modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our\napproach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are\nincorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable\nvilla-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including\nSIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper\nand dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds\nsignificant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for\nfuture research."}

A\nprimary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or\nenvironments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors\nacross diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this\nchallenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can\nachieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore\nRL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction\ncapabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL\nrepresentation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a\nunified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome\nthe significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task\nsynthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale\nmulti-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework\nto support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction\nsuccess rates by $4\\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial\nreasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our\nfindings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated\nenvironments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for\nsignificantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning."}

Although tactile sensors enable\nrobust, autonomous perception and navigation in natural systems, replicating\nthese capabilities in insect-scale robots remains challenging due to stringent\nsize, weight, and power constraints that limit existing sensor technologies. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce CITRAS (Cockroach Inspired Tactile\nRobotic Antenna Sensor), a bioinspired, multi-segmented, compliant laminate\nsensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors. CITRAS is compact (73.7x15.6x2.1\nmm), lightweight (491 mg), and low-power (32 mW), enabling seamless integration\nwith miniature robotic platforms. The segmented compliant structure passively\nbends in response to environmental stimuli, achieving accurate hinge angle\nmeasurements with maximum errors of just 0.79 degree (quasistatic bending) and\n3.58 degree (dynamic bending). Experimental evaluations demonstrate CITRAS'\nmultifunctional tactile perception capabilities: predicting base-to-tip\ndistances with 7.75 % error, estimating environmental gap widths with 6.73 %\nerror, and distinguishing surface textures through differential sensor\nresponse. The future integration of this bioinspired tactile antenna in\ninsect-scale robots addresses critical sensing gaps, promising enhanced\nautonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in\ncomplex, confined environments."}
