Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment\nassumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic\nSLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic\nfeatures, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point\nfeatures for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by\ncontinuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point\nfeatures, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current\nmethods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,\ncausing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential\nperformance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and\nnoise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism\nthat evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line\nfeature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system\nto introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing\ncomputational complexity of additional features while minimizing the\nintroduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the\nintroduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses\nthrough tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global\noptimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional\nfeatures in long-term process.

Recent work on\ntest-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on\nthe fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.\nHowever, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as\nmultiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for\ntest-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the\nfine-tuned features.

This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}
