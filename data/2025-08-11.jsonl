A surrogate-enhanced actuator\nmodel, combining integrated electromechanical dynamics with a neural network\ntrained on a dedicated testbed, is integrated into an extended virtual\ndecomposition control (VDC) architecture augmented by a natural adaptation law.\nThe derived analytical HDRM model supports a hierarchical control structure\nthat seamlessly maps high-level force and velocity objectives to real-time\nactuator commands, accompanied by a Lyapunov-based stability proof. In\nmulti-domain simulations of both cubic and a custom planar triangular\ntrajectory, the proposed adaptive modular controller achieves sub-centimeter\nCartesian tracking accuracy. Experimental validation of the same 1-DoF platform\nunder realistic load emulation confirms the efficacy of the proposed control\nstrategy. These findings demonstrate that a surrogate-enhanced EMLA model\nembedded in the VDC approach can enable modular, real-time control of an\nall-electric HDRM, supporting its deployment in next-generation mobile working\nmachines."}

Losey"], "title": "Towards Balanced Behavior Cloning from Imbalanced Datasets", "comment": null, "summary": "Robots should be able to learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations.\nIn practice, these human-provided datasets are inevitably imbalanced: i.e., the\nhuman demonstrates some subtasks more frequently than others. State-of-the-art\nmethods default to treating each element of the human's dataset as equally\nimportant. So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on\nreaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,\nthe learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching. More\ngenerally, misalignment between the relative amounts of data and the importance\nof that data causes fundamental problems for imitation learning approaches. In\nthis paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account\nfor mixed datasets. We formally prove that imbalanced data leads to imbalanced\npolicies when each state-action pair is weighted equally; these policies\nemulate the most represented behaviors, and not the human's complex, multi-task\ndemonstrations. We next explore algorithms that rebalance offline datasets\n(i.e., reweight the importance of different state-action pairs) without human\noversight. Reweighting the dataset can enhance the overall policy performance.\nHowever, there is no free lunch: each method for autonomously rebalancing\nbrings its own pros and cons. We formulate these advantages and disadvantages,\nhelping other researchers identify when each type of approach is most\nappropriate. We conclude by introducing a novel meta-gradient rebalancing\nalgorithm that addresses the primary limitations behind existing approaches.\nOur experiments show that dataset rebalancing leads to better downstream\nlearning, improving the performance of general imitation learning algorithms\nwithout requiring additional data collection.

Online calibration further suffers from weak excitation, leading\nto unreliable estimates. To address these limitations, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based extrinsic calibration framework that\nformulates extrinsic calibration as a decision-making problem, directly\noptimizes $SE(3)$ extrinsics to enhance odometry accuracy. Our approach\nleverages a probabilistic Bingham distribution to model 3D rotations, ensuring\nstable optimization while inherently retaining quaternion symmetry. A\ntrajectory alignment reward mechanism enables robust calibration without\nstructured targets by quantitatively evaluating estimated tightly-coupled\ntrajectory against a reference trajectory. Additionally, an automated data\nselection module filters uninformative samples, significantly improving\nefficiency and scalability for large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on\nUAVs, UGVs, and handheld platforms demonstrate that our method outperforms\ntraditional optimization-based approaches, achieving high-precision calibration\neven under weak excitation conditions. Our framework simplifies deployment on\ndiverse robotic platforms by eliminating the need for high-quality initial\nextrinsics and enabling calibration from routine operating data.

We introduce V*, a graph-based motion\nplanner that represents speed and direction as explicit state variables within\na discretised space-time-velocity lattice. Unlike traditional methods that\ndecouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing,\nV* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through\ndynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of\nhigh-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and\nprovide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and\nminimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for\nvelocity-aware motion planning. We develop a mathematical formulation for\ntransient steering dynamics in the kinematic bicycle model, modelling steering\nangle convergence with exponential behaviour, and deriving the relationship for\nconvergence rate parameters. This theoretical foundation, combined with\ngeometric pruning strategies that eliminate expansions leading to infeasible\nsteering configurations, enables V* to evaluate dynamically admissible\nmanoeuvres, ensuring each trajectory is physically realisable without further\nrefinement.

In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this\nlimited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the\ninherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically\ncomposed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied\nenvironments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into\ndataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios\nwhere acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that\ncarefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce\nshortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving\ngeneralization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\\pi_0$, in\nboth simulation and real-world environments.
