  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经血管导航中预弯曲被动工具的路径规划问题，需要确定性且时间高效的方法，同时考虑与解剖结构的相互作用。

Method: 推导运动学模型，由基于采样的规划器用于树扩展，利用简化的运动基元；结合术前和术中血管图像信息，智能预测和利用与解剖结构的相互作用。

Result: 在不同代表性血管解剖结构中，算法最坏情况下22.8秒内收敛率100%，跟踪误差亚毫米（小于0.64mm），对约94%患者代表性解剖体模有效。

Conclusion: 该接触感知路径规划器能快速计算可行路径，准确性损失可忽略，在神经血管导航中表现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: We propose a deterministic and time-efficient contact-aware path planner for neurovascular navigation. The algorithm leverages information from pre- and intra-operative images of the vessels to navigate pre-bent passive tools, by intelligently predicting and exploiting interactions with the anatomy. A kinematic model is derived and employed by the sampling-based planner for tree expansion that utilizes simplified motion primitives. This approach enables fast computation of the feasible path, with negligible loss in accuracy, as demonstrated in diverse and representative anatomies of the vessels. In these anatomical demonstrators, the algorithm shows a 100% convergence rate within 22.8s in the worst case, with sub-millimeter tracking errors (less than 0.64 mm), and is found effective on anatomical phantoms representative of around 94% of patients.

### [2] [Fiducial Exoskeletons: Image-Centric Robot State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08034)
*Cameron Smith,Basile Van Hoorick,Vitor Guizilini,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Fiducial Exoskeletons，一种基于图像的3D机器人状态估计重构方法，通过单图像推理替代繁琐流程和以电机为中心的管道，在低成本机器人上实现简化设置、提高校准精度和下游3D控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人状态估计方法（尤其是机器人-相机外参估计）依赖高精度执行器且需耗时的手眼校准等流程，而现代基于学习的机器人控制需从RGB观测中训练部署于低成本硬件，因此需简化流程并提升性能。

Method: 将机器人状态估计转化为从单RGB图像估计每个连杆的6D位姿：通过估计的基连杆位姿直接获得机器人-相机基变换，利用轻量级全局优化（可选编码器读数预热）恢复关节状态以强制与观测连杆位姿的运动学一致性；引入 fiducial exoskeleton，即每个连杆上带 fiducial marker 的轻量3D打印支架，已知 marker-连杆几何结构，实现鲁棒简单的单连杆6D位姿估计。

Result: 在低成本机械臂上验证，Fiducial Exoskeletons 显著简化设置，同时提高校准精度、状态准确性和下游3D控制性能，能从单图像获取鲁棒的相机-机器人外参、单连杆SE(3)位姿和关节角度状态，即使机器人未通电也可实现鲁棒状态估计。

Conclusion: Fiducial Exoskeletons 通过图像重构3D机器人状态估计，简化流程并提升性能，发布代码和可打印硬件设计以支持算法-硬件协同设计。

Abstract: We introduce Fiducial Exoskeletons, an image-based reformulation of 3D robot state estimation that replaces cumbersome procedures and motor-centric pipelines with single-image inference. Traditional approaches - especially robot-camera extrinsic estimation - often rely on high-precision actuators and require time-consuming routines such as hand-eye calibration. In contrast, modern learning-based robot control is increasingly trained and deployed from RGB observations on lower-cost hardware.
  Our key insight is twofold. First, we cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from a single RGB image: the robot-camera base transform is obtained directly as the estimated base-link pose, and the joint state is recovered via a lightweight global optimization that enforces kinematic consistency with the observed link poses (optionally warm-started with encoder readings). Second, we make per-link 6D pose estimation robust and simple - even without learning - by introducing the fiducial exoskeleton: a lightweight 3D-printed mount with a fiducial marker on each link and known marker-link geometry.
  This design yields robust camera-robot extrinsics, per-link SE(3) poses, and joint-angle state from a single image, enabling robust state estimation even on unplugged robots. Demonstrated on a low-cost robot arm, fiducial exoskeletons substantially simplify setup while improving calibration, state accuracy, and downstream 3D control performance. We release code and printable hardware designs to enable further algorithm-hardware co-design.

### [3] [Efficient Incremental SLAM via Information-Guided and Selective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08110)
*Reza Arablouei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An efficient incremental SLAM back-end combining information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO) achieves full batch optimization accuracy with reduced computational cost, maintaining global consistency and convergence guarantees, and shows significant computational savings on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost issue of incremental SLAM back-ends while maintaining the accuracy of full batch optimization.

Method: The approach combines information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG uses an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to trigger global optimization only when significant information gain is observed. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates, restricting each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by new measurements and dynamically refining the active set until convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show the approach matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers and achieves significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments.

Abstract: We present an efficient incremental SLAM back-end that achieves the accuracy of full batch optimization while substantially reducing computational cost. The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-limbed climbing robots with grippers may fall due to misgrasping or loss of graspable points in unknown natural environments; thus, a gripper with adaptive grasping for irregular terrains and accurate terrain shape measurement is needed.

Method: Developed a gripper with a pin-array structure to grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure terrain shape, demonstrated the mechanism, and evaluated performance using a prototype.

Result: The proposed pin-array design enables adaptive grasping for irregular terrains and works well for 3D terrain mapping.

Conclusion: The developed gripper with pin-array structure effectively achieves adaptive grasping of convex/concave terrains, accurate terrain shape measurement, and supports 3D terrain mapping, addressing issues of misgrasping and loss of graspable points in unknown natural environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a gripper capable of grasping and recognizing terrain shapes for mobile robots in extreme environments. Multi-limbed climbing robots with grippers are effective on rough terrains, such as cliffs and cave walls. However, such robots may fall over by misgrasping the surface or getting stuck owing to the loss of graspable points in unknown natural environments. To overcome these issues, we need a gripper capable of adaptive grasping to irregular terrains, not only for grasping but also for measuring the shape of the terrain surface accurately. We developed a gripper that can grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure the terrain shape by introducing a pin-array structure. We demonstrated the mechanism of the gripper and evaluated its grasping and terrain recognition performance using a prototype. Moreover, the proposed pin-array design works well for 3D terrain mapping as well as adaptive grasping for irregular terrains.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种数据高效的框架，利用预训练生成扩散模型中的物体中心语义先验，绕过机器人抓取数据收集，实现跨不同灵巧手的稳定、功能适当的多接触抓取，无需针对每个手进行再训练。


<details>

Abstract: Dexterous grasp synthesis remains a central challenge: the high dimensionality and kinematic diversity of multi-fingered hands prevent direct transfer of algorithms developed for parallel-jaw grippers. Existing approaches typically depend on large, hardware-specific grasp datasets collected in simulation or through costly real-world trials, hindering scalability as new dexterous hand designs emerge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision-language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics. Our results highlight a path toward scalable, hardware-agnostic dexterous manipulation driven by human demonstrations and pretrained generative models.

*Yaohua Liu,Qiao Xu,Yemin Wang,Hui Yi Leong,Binkai Ou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a brain-inspired state estimation framework combining a spiking neural network (SNN) and an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) to address the noise issue of low-cost IMUs in mobile robot localization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost IMUs have complex, nonlinear, and time-varying noise characteristics, leading to significant degradation in localization accuracy when used for dead reckoning.

Conclusion: The proposed brain-inspired framework enhances pose estimation robustness and accuracy, with potential for real-world mobile robot applications.

Abstract: Low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs) are widely utilized in mobile robot localization due to their affordability and ease of integration. However, their complex, nonlinear, and time-varying noise characteristics often lead to significant degradation in localization accuracy when applied directly for dead reckoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel brain-inspired state estimation framework that combines a spiking neural network (SNN) with an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). The SNN is designed to extract motion-related features from long sequences of IMU data affected by substantial random noise and is trained via a surrogate gradient descent algorithm to enable dynamic adaptation of the covariance noise parameter within the InEKF. By fusing the SNN output with raw IMU measurements, the proposed method enhances the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset and real-world data collected using a mobile robot equipped with a low-cost IMU demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and exhibits strong robustness to sensor noise, highlighting its potential for real-world mobile robot applications.

### [9] [ActiveVLA: Injecting Active Perception into Vision-Language-Action Models for Precise 3D Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08325)
*Zhenyang Liu,Yongchong Gu,Yikai Wang,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained robot manipulation, which divides into critical region localization and active perception optimization stages, outperforming baselines in simulations and transferring to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language-action (VLA) approaches for robot manipulation overlook active perception, relying on static wrist-mounted cameras that limit performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained scenarios by being unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints/resolutions.

Method: ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm with two stages: (1) Critical region localization: projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness; (2) Active perception optimization: uses active view selection to choose optimal viewpoints (maximizing amodal relevance/diversity, minimizing occlusions) and applies 3D zoom-in for key area resolution improvement.

Result: ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks, and transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios for high-precision tasks in complex environments.

Conclusion: ActiveVLA empowers robots with active perception capabilities, addressing limitations of static camera-based VLA approaches and enabling high-precision, fine-grained manipulation in both simulations and real-world complex environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in robot manipulation have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) and explored integrating 3D spatial signals into these models for effective action prediction, giving rise to the promising vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm. However, most existing approaches overlook the importance of active perception: they typically rely on static, wrist-mounted cameras that provide an end-effector-centric viewpoint. As a result, these models are unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints or resolutions during task execution, which significantly limits their performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that empowers robots with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained manipulation. ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm, dividing the process into two stages: (1) Critical region localization. ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks. Moreover, ActiveVLA transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios, enabling robots to learn high-precision tasks in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework enabling structurally heterogeneous teams of agents to jointly discover and acquire randomly located targets in environments characterized by partial observability, communication constraints, and dynamic interactions.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to enable legged robots to learn how to interpret human social cues and produce appropriate behaviors through physical human guidance.

We reconstruct interaction scenes using a physics-based simulation and aggregate data to mitigate distributional shifts arising from limited demonstration data. Our progressive goal cueing strategy adaptively feeds appropriate commands and navigation goals during training, leading to more accurate navigation and stronger alignment between human input and robot behavior. We evaluate our framework across six real-world agile navigation scenarios, including jumping over or avoiding obstacles. Our experimental results show that our proposed method succeeds in almost all trials across these scenarios, achieving a 97.15% task success rate with less than 1 hour of demonstration data in total.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables interpretable, intent-driven, and autonomously Real2Sim pipelines, bridging high-level reasoning with physically-grounded robotic interaction.

Abstract: Constructing an accurate simulation model of real-world environments requires reliable estimation of physical parameters such as mass, geometry, friction, and contact surfaces. Traditional real-to-simulation (Real2Sim) pipelines rely on manual measurements or fixed, pre-programmed exploration routines, which limit their adaptability to varying tasks and user intents. This paper presents a Real2Sim framework that autonomously generates and executes Behavior Trees for task-specific physical interactions to acquire only the parameters required for a given simulation objective, without relying on pre-defined task templates or expert-designed exploration routines. Given a high-level user request, an incomplete simulation description, and an RGB observation of the scene, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects, infer required physical parameters, and generate a structured Behavior Tree composed of elementary robotic actions. The resulting behavior is executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda, enabling compliant, contact-rich interactions for parameter estimation. The acquired measurements are used to automatically construct a physics-aware simulation. Experimental results on the real manipulator demonstrate estimation of object mass, surface height, and friction-related quantities across multiple scenarios, including occluded objects and incomplete prior models. The proposed approach enables interpretable, intent-driven, and autonomously Real2Sim pipelines, bridging high-level reasoning with physically-grounded robotic interaction.

*Chong Zhang,Victor Klemm,Fan Yang,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AME-2 is a unified RL framework for agile and generalized legged locomotion, incorporating an attention-based map encoder and a learning-based mapping pipeline to enhance generalization, interpretability, and robustness to occlusions/noise, validated on quadruped and biped robots in simulation and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either achieve agility with end-to-end sensorimotor models (limited generalization/interpretability) or target generalized locomotion (limited agility, struggle with visual occlusions), requiring a unified framework integrating perception and control for agile and generalized legged locomotion across terrains under occlusions and sparse footholds.

Method: AME-2 framework: 1) Attention-based map encoder in control policy to extract local/global mapping features, use attention to focus on salient regions, producing interpretable/generalized embedding for RL control. 2) Learning-based mapping pipeline: neural networks convert depth observations to local elevations with uncertainties, fuse with odometry, integrate with parallel simulation for training controllers with online mapping to aid sim-to-real transfer.

Result: Controllers trained with AME-2 and the mapping pipeline demonstrate strong agility and generalization to unseen terrains in simulation and real-world experiments on quadruped and biped robots.

Conclusion: AME-2 effectively integrates perception and control via attention-based encoding and learning-based mapping, enabling agile and generalized legged locomotion across terrains with robustness to occlusions and noise.

Abstract: Achieving agile and generalized legged locomotion across terrains requires tight integration of perception and control, especially under occlusions and sparse footholds. Existing methods have demonstrated agility on parkour courses but often rely on end-to-end sensorimotor models with limited generalization and interpretability. By contrast, methods targeting generalized locomotion typically exhibit limited agility and struggle with visual occlusions. We introduce AME-2, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile and generalized locomotion that incorporates a novel attention-based map encoder in the control policy. This encoder extracts local and global mapping features and uses attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions, producing an interpretable and generalized embedding for RL-based control. We further propose a learning-based mapping pipeline that provides fast, uncertainty-aware terrain representations robust to noise and occlusions, serving as policy inputs. It uses neural networks to convert depth observations into local elevations with uncertainties, and fuses them with odometry. The pipeline also integrates with parallel simulation so that we can train controllers with online mapping, aiding sim-to-real transfer. We validate AME-2 with the proposed mapping pipeline on a quadruped and a biped robot, and the resulting controllers demonstrate strong agility and generalization to unseen terrains in simulation and in real-world experiments.

Motivation: Conventional IoUT devices rely on battery power, facing limitations in lifespan and environmental hazards upon disposal.

Method: Adopt age of information (AoI) and Jain's fairness index, develop two deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms: high-complexity, high-performance frequency division duplex (FDD) solution and low-complexity, medium-performance time division duplex (TDD) approach.

Result: The proposed FDD and TDD solutions significantly reduce the average AoI and boost the harvested energy as well as data collection fairness compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The sustainable approach via AUV for simultaneous uplink and AET, along with the developed DRL algorithms, effectively addresses battery limitations of IoUT devices, enabling potential indefinite operation with improved performance metrics.

Abstract: Internet of underwater things (IoUT) is increasingly gathering attention with the aim of monitoring sea life and deep ocean environment, underwater surveillance as well as maintenance of underwater installments. However, conventional IoUT devices, reliant on battery power, face limitations in lifespan and pose environmental hazards upon disposal. This paper introduces a sustainable approach for simultaneous information uplink from the IoUT devices and acoustic energy transfer (AET) to the devices via an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), potentially enabling them to operate indefinitely. To tackle the time-sensitivity, we adopt age of information (AoI), and Jain's fairness index. We develop two deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, offering a high-complexity, high-performance frequency division duplex (FDD) solution and a low-complexity, medium-performance time division duplex (TDD) approach. The results elucidate that the proposed FDD and TDD solutions significantly reduce the average AoI and boost the harvested energy as well as data collection fairness compared to baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel modular ROS2 architecture with a Reference Generator component that decouples reference-handling logic from control laws, reducing code duplication and improving reusability, validated on simulated and real manipulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To remove duplicated reference-handling code from controllers and enhance reusability across robot platforms in ROS2.

Method: Design a dedicated Reference Generator component to handle reference acquisition, validation, and interpolation, implementing joint-space and Cartesian reference generators, along with new controllers (PD with gravity compensation, Cartesian pose, admittance), and validating on Universal Robots and Franka Emika manipulators.

Result: (i) Reliable reference tracking in all tested scenarios; (ii) Reduced duplicated reference-handling code across chained controllers, facilitating complex controller pipeline construction/reuse; (iii) Controller implementations focused solely on control laws.

Conclusion: The proposed modular architecture effectively decouples reference-handling from control laws, improving reusability and reducing code duplication, with reliable performance validated on real and simulated manipulators.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel modular architecture for ROS2 that decouples the logic required to acquire, validate, and interpolate references from the control laws that track them. The design includes a dedicated component, named Reference Generator, that receives references, in the form of either single points or trajectories, from external nodes (e.g., planners), and writes single-point references at the controller's sampling period via the existing ros2_control chaining mechanism to downstream controllers. This separation removes duplicated reference-handling code from controllers and improves reusability across robot platforms. We implement two reference generators: one for handling joint-space references and one for Cartesian references, along with a set of new controllers (PD with gravity compensation, Cartesian pose, and admittance controllers) and validate the approach on simulated and real Universal Robots and Franka Emika manipulators. Results show that (i) references are tracked reliably in all tested scenarios, (ii) reference generators reduce duplicated reference-handling code across chained controllers to favor the construction and reuse of complex controller pipelines, and (iii) controller implementations remain focused only on control laws.

Result: The paper compares the proposed method with Octomap and NDT-OM and provides example applications of the mapping method (specific performance metrics not detailed in the abstract).

Conclusion: The proposed keyframe-based mapping system effectively utilizes RGB-D camera properties and uncertainty, achieves higher precision for nearby objects, enables global map correction via loop closure, and demonstrates feasibility through comparisons and example applications.

Abstract: In this article, we propose a new keyframe-based mapping system. The proposed method updates local Normal Distribution Transform maps (NDT) using data from an RGB-D sensor. The cells of the NDT are stored in 2D view-dependent structures to better utilize the properties and uncertainty model of RGB-D cameras. This method naturally represents an object closer to the camera origin with higher precision. The local maps are stored in the pose graph which allows correcting global map after loop closure detection. We also propose a procedure that allows merging and filtering local maps to obtain a global map of the environment. Finally, we compare our method with Octomap and NDT-OM and provide example applications of the proposed mapping method.

Conclusion: VLingNav通过语言驱动认知机制有效提升VLA模型在复杂长时导航任务中的推理与记忆能力，验证了其在基准测试和真实机器人平台的有效性与泛化性。

Abstract: VLA models have shown promising potential in embodied navigation by unifying perception and planning while inheriting the strong generalization abilities of large VLMs. However, most existing VLA models rely on reactive mappings directly from observations to actions, lacking the explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory required for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.
