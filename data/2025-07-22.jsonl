Meanwhile, a UAM system, serving as an air taxi,\nrequires adaptive planning to respond to real-time passenger requests,\nespecially in ride-sharing scenarios where passenger demands are unpredictable\nand dynamic. However, conventional trajectory planning strategies based on\npredefined routes lack the flexibility to meet varied passenger ride demands.\nTo address these challenges, this work first proposes constructing a radio map\nto evaluate the communication quality of urban airspace. Building on this, we\nintroduce a novel Multi-Source Hybrid Attention Reinforcement Learning\n(MSHA-RL) framework for the challenge of effectively focusing on passengers and\nUAM locations, which arises from the significant dimensional disparity between\nthe representations. This model first generates the alignment among diverse\ndata sources with large gap dimensions before employing hybrid attention to\nbalance global and local insights, thereby facilitating responsive, real-time\npath planning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the approach\nenables communication-compliant trajectory planning, reducing travel time and\nenhancing operational efficiency while prioritizing passenger safety."}

Simple parallel grippers often struggle with such tasks due to\nlimited dexterity and actuation constraints.

In contrast to\ntraditional search-based approaches, the newly developed approach considers\nother road users (e.g. drivers and pedestrians) as intelligent agents rather\nthan static obstacles. This leads to the generation of a more realistic path\nfor the AV. Due to the low computational time, the proposed motion planning\nscheme is implementable in real-time applications. The performance of the\ndeveloped motion planning scheme is compared with existing motion planning\ntechniques and validated through experiments using WATonoBus, an electrical\nall-weather autonomous shuttle bus."}

The device is miniaturized (4 mm outer diameter, 2 mm\ninner diameter, 40 mm length), 3D printed using biocompatible SIL 30 material,\nand integrates embedded Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for real-time shape\nfeedback. Shape reconstruction is represented using four Bezier control points,\nenabling a compact and smooth model of the device's deformation. A data-driven\nmodel was trained on 5,097 experimental samples covering a range of magnetic\nfield magnitudes (0-14 mT), actuation frequencies (0.2-1.0 Hz), and vertical\ntip distances (90-100 mm), using both Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest\n(RF) architectures. The RF model outperformed the NN across all metrics,\nachieving a mean root mean square error of 0.087 mm in control point prediction\nand a mean shape reconstruction error of 0.064 mm. Feature importance analysis\nfurther revealed that magnetic field components predominantly influence distal\ncontrol points, while frequency and distance affect the base configuration.\nThis learning-based approach effectively models the complex nonlinear behavior\nof hyperelastic soft robots under magnetic actuation without relying on\nsimplified physical assumptions. By enabling sub-millimeter shape prediction\naccuracy and real-time inference, this work represents an advancement toward\nthe intelligent control of magnetically actuated soft robotic tools in\nminimally invasive neurosurgery."}

However, existing methods show significant trade-offs between\ncomputational efficiency and accuracy during inference. The substantial memory\nand computational requirements make them unsuitable for real-time applications,\nhighlighting the need to improve the completeness and accuracy of depth\ninformation while improving processing speed to enhance robot performance in\nvarious tasks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose\nCHADET(cross-hierarchical-attention depth-completion transformer), a\nlightweight depth-completion network that can generate accurate dense depth\nmaps from RGB images and sparse depth points. For each pair, its feature is\nextracted from the depthwise blocks and passed to the equally lightweight\ntransformer-based decoder. In the decoder, we utilize the novel\ncross-hierarchical-attention module that refines the image features from the\ndepth information.

To imitate this cognitive ability\nin urban autonomous driving while ensuring the transparency and\ninterpretability, we propose a vision-language model (VLM)-enhanced unified\ndecision-making and motion control framework, named VLM-UDMC. This framework\nincorporates scene reasoning and risk-aware insights into an upper-level slow\nsystem, which dynamically reconfigures the optimal motion planning for the\ndownstream fast system. The reconfiguration is based on real-time environmental\nchanges, which are encoded through context-aware potential functions. More\nspecifically, the upper-level slow system employs a two-step reasoning policy\nwith Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging foundation models to\nprocess multimodal inputs and retrieve contextual knowledge, thereby generating\nrisk-aware insights. Meanwhile, a lightweight multi-kernel decomposed LSTM\nprovides real-time trajectory predictions for heterogeneous traffic\nparticipants by extracting smoother trend representations for short-horizon\ntrajectory prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed VLM-UDMC framework is\nverified via both simulations and real-world experiments with a full-size\nautonomous vehicle.

However, data-driven inertial localization methods\noften rely on increasingly complex network architectures to improve accuracy,\nwhich challenges the limited computational resources of IoT devices. Moreover,\nthese methods frequently overlook the importance of modeling long-term\ndependencies in inertial measurements - a critical factor for accurate\ntrajectory reconstruction - thereby limiting localization performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a reparameterized inertial localization\nnetwork that uses a multi-branch structure during training to enhance feature\nextraction. At inference time, this structure is transformed into an equivalent\nsingle-path architecture to improve parameter efficiency. To further capture\nlong-term dependencies in motion trajectories, we introduce a temporal-scale\nsparse attention mechanism that selectively emphasizes key trajectory segments\nwhile suppressing noise. Additionally, a gated convolutional unit is\nincorporated to effectively integrate long-range dependencies with local\nfine-grained features. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate\nthat our method achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and model\ncompactness.

Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but\nthey either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow\nrecirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this\nwork, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for\nhovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We\ndevelop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates\nlocal airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a\ndisturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which\ninfers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances\nare integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement\nlearning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during\nlateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time\ndisturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract\ntransient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe\nwall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first\ndemonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time\nflow field measurements.

In this context, Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar is capable of penetrating\nthrough such challenging environmental conditions due to the lower frequency\ncomponents within its broad bandwidth. Therefore, UWB radar has emerged as a\npotential sensing technology for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\nin vision-denied environments where optical sensors (e.g. LiDAR, Camera) are\nprone to failure. Existing approaches involving UWB radar as the primary\nexteroceptive sensor generally extract features in the environment, which are\nlater initialized as landmarks in a map. However, these methods are constrained\nby the number of distinguishable features in the environment. Hence, this paper\nproposes a novel method incorporating UWB Angle of Arrival (AOA) measurements\ninto UWB radar-based SLAM systems to improve the accuracy and scalability of\nSLAM in feature-deficient environments. The AOA measurements are obtained using\nUWB anchor-tag units which are dynamically deployed by the robot in featureless\nareas during mapping of the environment. This paper thoroughly discusses\nprevailing constraints associated with UWB AOA measurement units and presents\nsolutions to overcome them. Our experimental results show that integrating UWB\nAOA units with UWB radar enables SLAM in vision-denied feature-deficient\nenvironments."}

This enables the simultaneous consideration of\nexplicit rules and neural models trained on noisy data, combining the strength\nof structured reasoning with flexible representations. To this end, we\nintroduce the Constitutional Controller (CoCo), a novel framework designed to\nenhance the safety and reliability of agents by reasoning over deep\nprobabilistic logic programs representing constraints such as those found in\nshared traffic spaces.

Multiple kiwifruit detachment mechanisms were\ndesigned and field testing of one of the concepts showed that the mechanism\ncould reliably pick kiwifruit. Furthermore, this kiwifruit detachment mechanism\nwas able to reach over 80 percent of fruit in the cluttered kiwifruit canopy,\nwhereas the previous state of the art mechanism was only able to reach less\nthan 70 percent of the fruit. Artificial pollination was performed by detecting\nflowers and then spraying pollen in solution onto the detected flowers from a\nline of sprayers on a boom, while driving at up to 1.4 ms-1. In addition, the\nheight of the canopy was measured and the spray boom was moved up and down to\nkeep the boom close enough to the flowers for the spray to reach the flowers,\nwhile minimising collisions with the canopy. Mobile robot navigation was\nperformed using a 2D lidar in apple orchards and vineyards. Lidar navigation in\nkiwifruit orchards was more challenging because the pergola structure only\nprovides a small amount of data for the direction of rows, compared to the\namount of data from the overhead canopy, the undulating ground and other\nobjects in the orchards. Multiple methods are presented here for extracting\nstructure defining features from 3D lidar data in kiwifruit orchards. In\naddition, a 3D lidar navigation system -- which performed row following, row\nend detection and row end turns -- was tested for over 30 km of autonomous\ndriving in kiwifruit orchards. Computer vision algorithms for row detection and\nrow following were also tested. The computer vision algorithm worked as well as\nthe 3D lidar row following method in testing."}

This paper aims to enable\nnon-expert users to program in-contact motions more efficiently by eliminating\nthe need for a dedicated PIP calibration, thereby enabling flexible robot tool\nchanges. Since demonstrated tasks generally also contain motions with\nnon-contact, our approach uses these parts to estimate the robot's PIP using\nestablished estimation techniques.

Unlike conventional\ndifferentiable particle filters, which require importance weighting and\ntypically rely on predefined or low-capacity proposal distributions. DiffPF\nlearns a flexible posterior sampler by conditioning a diffusion model on\npredicted particles and the current observation. This enables accurate,\nequally-weighted sampling from complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal\nfiltering distributions. We evaluate DiffPF across a range of scenarios,\nincluding both unimodal and highly multimodal distributions, and test it on\nsimulated as well as real-world tasks, where it consistently outperforms\nexisting filtering baselines. In particular, DiffPF achieves an 82.8%\nimprovement in estimation accuracy on a highly multimodal global localization\nbenchmark, and a 26% improvement on the real-world KITTI visual odometry\nbenchmark, compared to state-of-the-art differentiable filters. To the best of\nour knowledge, DiffPF is the first method to integrate conditional diffusion\nmodels into particle filtering, enabling high-quality posterior sampling that\nproduces more informative particles and significantly improves state\nestimation."}

Existing HRI systems demonstrate great progress\nin interpreting and following user instructions, action generation, and robot\ntask solving. On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware\nsupport of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive\nrobot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision\ninputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to\nbe modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is\ncapable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and\nfast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple\npublic dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved\nrobustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the\nperformance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted\nHRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances\nadaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics\nbut may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for\nmore straightforward tasks."}

To push this\nboundary, we consider a generalized multi-object collection problem in large\nscene graphs, where the robot needs to pick up and place multiple objects\nacross multiple locations in a long mission of multiple human commands. This\nproblem is extremely challenging since it requires long-horizon planning in a\nvast action-state space under high uncertainties. To this end, we propose a\nnovel interleaved LLM and motion planning algorithm Inter-LLM. By designing a\nmultimodal action cost similarity function, our algorithm can both reflect the\nhistory and look into the future to optimize plans, striking a good balance of\nquality and efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that compared with\nlatest works, our algorithm improves the overall mission performance by 30% in\nterms of fulfilling human commands, maximizing mission success rates, and\nminimizing mission costs."}

In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,\nuniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how\nincorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both\nefficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image\nprocessing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both\nhuman head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA\nrobot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously\ncollecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as\nwell as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that\nincorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide\nfoveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,\nallowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results\nshow that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces\ncomputational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks\nand robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that\nhuman-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic\nvision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/"}
