The\nexperimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise\non human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM\nreflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more\npronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human\ncondition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences\nthe assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest,\nwhile collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations.\nScenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those\nwithout them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and\ninteraction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative\nrobots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight\nthe potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback,\nsupporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic\nsystems tailored to diverse populations."}

While optimisation methods exist for\ncontrolling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive\nknowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in\nreal-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable\nalternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of\nsample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and\npredictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the\nsafety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nintroduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages\nphysical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\\'ezier\ncurves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive\nsimulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our\napproach over existing alternatives."}

Its\naccuracy plays a crucial role in the perception pipeline, as any errors can\nhave implications for the safety of the vehicle. Modern sensor systems collect\ndifferent types of data from the environment, making it harder to align the\ndata. To this end, we propose a target-based extrinsic calibration system\ntailored for a multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor suite. This system enables\ncross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge using\na custom ChArUco board and a tailored nonlinear optimization method. We test\nthe system with real-world data gathered in a warehouse. Results demonstrated\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting the feasibility of a\nunique pipeline tailored for various types of sensors."}

On the hardware side, earlier approaches\neither use rigid-driven mechanisms, which provide precise control but are\ndifficult to design within constrained spaces, or tendon-driven mechanisms,\nwhich are more space-efficient but challenging to control. In contrast, we\npropose a hybrid actuation approach that combines the best of both worlds. The\neyes and mouth-key areas for emotional expression-are controlled using rigid\nmechanisms for precise movement, while the nose and cheek, which convey subtle\nfacial microexpressions, are driven by strings. This design allows us to build\na compact yet versatile hardware platform capable of expressing a wide range of\nemotions. On the algorithmic side, our method introduces a self-modeling\nnetwork that maps motor actions to facial landmarks, allowing us to\nautomatically establish the relationship between blendshape coefficients for\ndifferent facial expressions and the corresponding motor control signals\nthrough gradient backpropagation. We then train a neural network to map speech\ninput to corresponding blendshape controls. With our method, we can generate\ndistinct emotional expressions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and anger,\nfrom any given sentence, each with nuanced, emotion-specific control signals-a\nfeature that has not been demonstrated in earlier systems.

However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet\ndata, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents\nExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a\nself-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM\nautonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts\nrobot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this\nprocess are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of\nlearned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with\nan on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection\nimproves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and\nobserve the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative\ntool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight\nunseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial\nsuccess rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of ExpTeach."}
