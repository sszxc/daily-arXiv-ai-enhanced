Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for\ngenerating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D\ntrajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this\nwork, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating\nplausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the\ntext instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a\nreconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along\nwith a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D\nfirst reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and\nthen computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length\nwhile avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create\nvideo sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.\nThis process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion\nmodel to produce robotic pick-and-place videos.

For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,\naccurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In\nthis work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator\nfor event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid\nboard. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in\neKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and\nefficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be\naccurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization\nis conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The\nresults of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can\nachieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The\nimplementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at\n(https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community."}

The packing of footwear products is a typical representative\npaired-item packing task involving irregular shapes and deformable objects.\nAlthough studies on shoe packing have been conducted, different initial states\ndue to the irregular shapes of shoes and standard packing placement poses have\nnot been considered. This study proposes a robotic manipulation framework,\nincluding a perception module, reorientation planners, and a packing planner,\nthat can complete the packing of pairs of shoes in any initial state. First, to\nadapt to the large intraclass variations due to the state, shape, and\ndeformation of the shoe, we propose a vision module based on semantic\nkeypoints, which can also infer more information such as size, state, pose, and\nmanipulation points by combining geometric features. Subsequently, we not only\nproposed primitive-based reorientation methods for different states of a single\ndeformable shoe but also proposed a fast reorientation method for the top state\nusing box edge contact and gravity, which further improved the efficiency of\nreorientation. Finally, based on the perception module and reorientation\nmethods, we propose a task planner for shoe pair packing in any initial state\nto provide an optimal packing strategy. Real-world experiments were conducted\nto verify the robustness of the reorientation methods and the effectiveness of\nthe packing strategy for various types of shoes.

While prior research has\nprimarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a\ndestination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot\nneeds to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact\nenergy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the\nObject-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses\nenergy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one\nof many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,\nwe first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a\nvariant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit\neach pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from\nhigh computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To\nmitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages\nmultiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to\nour solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of\nthe Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints.

In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that\nsystematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through\nthree integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning\ndetection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix.\nThis technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and\ntranslational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy\npatterns in conventional analyses.

The growing prevalence of\ncollaborative robots in industrial environments has increased the need for\nreliable safety systems. However, the lack of high-quality datasets that\ncapture realistic human-robot interactions, including potentially dangerous\nevents, slows development. LiHRA addresses this challenge by providing a\ncomprehensive, multi-modal dataset combining 3D LiDAR point clouds, human body\nkeypoints, and robot joint states, capturing the complete spatial and dynamic\ncontext of human-robot collaboration. This combination of modalities allows for\nprecise tracking of human movement, robot actions, and environmental\nconditions, enabling accurate RM during collaborative tasks. The LiHRA dataset\ncovers six representative HRI scenarios involving collaborative and coexistent\ntasks, object handovers, and surface polishing, with safe and hazardous\nversions of each scenario. In total, the data set includes 4,431 labeled point\nclouds recorded at 10 Hz, providing a rich resource for training and\nbenchmarking classical and AI-driven RM algorithms. Finally, to demonstrate\nLiHRA's utility, we introduce an RM method that quantifies the risk level in\neach scenario over time. This method leverages contextual information,\nincluding robot states and the dynamic model of the robot. With its combination\nof high-resolution LiDAR data, precise human tracking, robot state data, and\nrealistic collision events, LiHRA offers an essential foundation for future\nresearch into real-time RM and adaptive safety strategies in human-robot\nworkspaces."}
