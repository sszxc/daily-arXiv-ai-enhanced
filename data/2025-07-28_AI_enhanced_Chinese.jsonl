In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between\nsubsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling\nalgorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables\npredicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state\nobservations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This\npaper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static\nfeatures. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together\nmixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that\nfeatures will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The\napproach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating\nthe states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at\narbitrary future times.

Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --\ni.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a\nnovel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are\nequivariant to 90{\\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two\nplanes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by\na new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of\ndeformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.\nThis allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while\npreserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations\nof two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD.

Reinforcement\nlearning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to\nlearn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies\non rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current\nscenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a\nbalance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which\nprogressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising\napproach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies.\nHowever, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula,\nfocusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics.\nThis work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum\nlearning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively\ngenerates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive\nmechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring\nexposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical. The student, though\nexchangeable, is realized as a deep RL agent with partial observability,\nreflecting real-world perception constraints. Results demonstrate the teacher's\nability to generate diverse traffic behaviors.
