To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the\nreaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the\neffects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical\nencounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots.

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo.

Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are\nsuboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.\nPost-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality\nfor efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing\none arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms.

A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to\nmimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to\ndevelop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,\nsuch systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the\nability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky\ncontrol systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for\ndesigning and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing\ndistributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines\n3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight\nactuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We\ndeveloped LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby\nachieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,\nwhich in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to\ncapitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:\none to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target\ndeformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits\nto achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots\nthat show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to\ntheir environment.

We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of\npedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to\ndistribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction\nuncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses\nthese estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement\nlearning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt\nto distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a\n96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous\nstate-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times\nfewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three\nout-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when\nfacing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and\ntransitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real\nrobot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when\ninteracting with both sparse and dense crowds.
