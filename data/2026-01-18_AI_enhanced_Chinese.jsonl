However, their successful implementation requires not only technical robustness but also context-sensitive, co-designed solutions. This paper presents Mobirobot, a socially assistive robot developed to support mobilisation in children recovering from trauma, fractures, or depressive disorders through personalised exercise programmes.\n  Methods: An agile, human-centred development approach guided the iterative design of Mobirobot. Multidisciplinary clinical teams and end users were involved throughout the co-development process, which focused on early integration into real-world paediatric surgical and psychiatric settings. The robot, based on the NAO platform, features a simple setup, adaptable exercise routines with interactive guidance, motivational dialogue, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and no-code system feedback.\n  Results: Deployment in hospital environments enabled the identification of key design requirements and usability constraints. Stakeholder feedback led to refinements in interaction design, movement capabilities, and technical configuration. A feasibility study is currently underway to assess acceptance, usability, and perceived therapeutic benefit, with data collection including questionnaires, behavioural observations, and staff-patient interviews.\n  Discussion: Mobirobot demonstrates how multiprofessional, stakeholder-led development can yield a socially assistive system suited for dynamic inpatient settings.

Ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency in such settings requires that robots are endowed with a model of how humans move around them. Human motion prediction around robots is especially challenging due to the stochasticity of human behavior, differences in user preferences, and data scarcity. In this work, we perform a methodical investigation of the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, as well as human productivity and impressions. We design a scenario involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace and instantiate it in a user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms, conducted across two sites from different world regions. Key findings include evidence that: 1) the widely adopted average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions; 2) the common assumption of human cooperation breaks down in constrained environments, with users often not reciprocating robot cooperation, and causing performance degradations; 3) more efficient robot navigation often comes at the expense of human efficiency and comfort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff08N=80\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u53ca\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u5931\u6548\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u5e38\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4ed3\u5e93\u3001\u533b\u9662\u3001\u5de5\u5382\u53ca\u5bb6\u5ead\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u9700\u8d4b\u4e88\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4f7f\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6545\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u4e24\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4e16\u754c\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u70b9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u5f00\u5c55\u5305\u542b80\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u67e5\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5370\u8c61\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5e38\u4e0d\u56de\u62a5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5408\u4f5c\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b3\uff09\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u5f80\u5f80\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u53ca\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5931\u6548\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f53\u9a8c\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Existing gantry-based systems achieve high accuracy but lack mobility, while mobile platforms struggle to maintain print quality on uneven ground. We present a framework that tightly integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with multi-modal sensor fusion and hierarchical hardware control, forming a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system. The AI module learns terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation rather than reactive correction.

However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them. These are then incorporated into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories. Experiments in simulation and in a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities.

Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases.

However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework to address the gap that existing techniques (Bayesian methods and symbolic identification methods) struggle to meet the requirements of digital twins (high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability) simultaneously.
