However, existing methods lack\nspatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual\nplans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem,\nwe propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic\nmanipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning.\nSpecifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation\nmodule to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table.\nThen, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable\nactions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback\npolicy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive\nexperiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,\nachieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline.

For more\n  details please visit https://frankzhaodong.github.io/UnPose", "summary": "Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging\nproblem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,\nacquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to\nbypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to\nreconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require\nadditional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose\nUnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation\nand reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a\npre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D\nframe, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model\nusing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise\nepistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,\nwe incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the\ndiffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose\nestimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global\nconsistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations\nare further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent\n3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly\noutperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D\nreconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in\nreal-world robotic manipulation tasks."}

Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile\nsensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking\nand reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for\nin-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present\nGelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to\nestimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high\nfidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses\ntactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop\nclosure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal\ndrift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture\nobjects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local\ncontact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it\nwill serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving\ninteraction with objects in hand.

When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts\nwith the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions.
