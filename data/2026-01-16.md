Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents Mobirobot, a socially assistive robot developed via an agile, human-centred approach with multidisciplinary and end-user involvement to support children recovering from trauma, fractures, or depressive disorders through personalised exercise programmes, and discusses its design, deployment findings, and future prospects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Socially assistive robots need context-sensitive, co-designed solutions for successful implementation in paediatric clinical settings, beyond just technical robustness, to enhance therapeutic engagement.

Method: An agile, human-centred development approach was used, involving multidisciplinary clinical teams and end users in iterative co-development with early integration into real-world paediatric surgical and psychiatric settings; the robot, based on the NAO platform, has features like simple setup, adaptable exercise routines with interactive guidance, motivational dialogue, and a GUI for monitoring and no-code system feedback.

Result: Deployment in hospitals identified key design requirements and usability constraints; stakeholder feedback led to refinements in interaction design, movement capabilities, and technical configuration, and a feasibility study is ongoing to assess acceptance, usability, and perceived therapeutic benefit with data from questionnaires, behavioural observations, and interviews.

Conclusion: Mobirobot shows that multiprofessional, stakeholder-led development can create a socially assistive system suitable for dynamic inpatient settings, with early findings highlighting the importance of contextual integration, robustness, and minimal-intrusion design, despite remaining challenges like sensor limitations and patient recruitment, offering a promising foundation for further research and clinical application.

Abstract: Introduction: Socially assistive robots hold promise for enhancing therapeutic engagement in paediatric clinical settings. However, their successful implementation requires not only technical robustness but also context-sensitive, co-designed solutions. This paper presents Mobirobot, a socially assistive robot developed to support mobilisation in children recovering from trauma, fractures, or depressive disorders through personalised exercise programmes.
  Methods: An agile, human-centred development approach guided the iterative design of Mobirobot. Multidisciplinary clinical teams and end users were involved throughout the co-development process, which focused on early integration into real-world paediatric surgical and psychiatric settings. The robot, based on the NAO platform, features a simple setup, adaptable exercise routines with interactive guidance, motivational dialogue, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and no-code system feedback.
  Results: Deployment in hospital environments enabled the identification of key design requirements and usability constraints. Stakeholder feedback led to refinements in interaction design, movement capabilities, and technical configuration. A feasibility study is currently underway to assess acceptance, usability, and perceived therapeutic benefit, with data collection including questionnaires, behavioural observations, and staff-patient interviews.
  Discussion: Mobirobot demonstrates how multiprofessional, stakeholder-led development can yield a socially assistive system suited for dynamic inpatient settings. Early-stage findings underscore the importance of contextual integration, robustness, and minimal-intrusion design. While challenges such as sensor limitations and patient recruitment remain, the platform offers a promising foundation for further research and clinical application.

### [2] [How Human Motion Prediction Quality Shapes Social Robot Navigation Performance in Constrained Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09856)
*Andrew Stratton,Phani Teja Singamaneni,Pranav Goyal,Rachid Alami,Christoforos Mavrogiannis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, human productivity, and impressions in dynamic and spatially constrained environments through a user study with 80 participants across two sites and two robot platforms, finding average displacement error is unreliable, human cooperation assumption breaks down, and robot efficiency may harm human efficiency/comfort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate mobile robots closer to humans in dynamic and spatially constrained environments (warehouses, hospitals, etc.), ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency requires robots to model human movement, but human motion prediction is challenging due to stochastic behavior, user preference differences, and data scarcity.

Method: A methodical investigation via a user study (N=80) involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace, instantiated across two sites from different world regions with two different robot platforms.

Result: Key findings: 1) Average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions. 2) Human cooperation assumption breaks down in constrained environments, with users not reciprocating robot cooperation, causing performance degradation. 3) More efficient robot navigation often reduces human efficiency and comfort.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical limitations in current human motion prediction metrics and assumptions (e.g., cooperation) for robot navigation in constrained human-robot interaction settings, emphasizing the need to balance robot and human efficiency/comfort.

Abstract: Motivated by the vision of integrating mobile robots closer to humans in warehouses, hospitals, manufacturing plants, and the home, we focus on robot navigation in dynamic and spatially constrained environments. Ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency in such settings requires that robots are endowed with a model of how humans move around them. Human motion prediction around robots is especially challenging due to the stochasticity of human behavior, differences in user preferences, and data scarcity. In this work, we perform a methodical investigation of the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, as well as human productivity and impressions. We design a scenario involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace and instantiate it in a user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms, conducted across two sites from different world regions. Key findings include evidence that: 1) the widely adopted average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions; 2) the common assumption of human cooperation breaks down in constrained environments, with users often not reciprocating robot cooperation, and causing performance degradations; 3) more efficient robot navigation often comes at the expense of human efficiency and comfort.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SyncTwin is a digital twin framework unifying fast 3D scene reconstruction and real-to-sim synchronization for robust, safety-aware robotic grasping under dynamic and visually occluded conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and safe grasping under dynamic and visually occluded conditions is a core challenge in real-world robotic manipulation.

Method: Offline: Use VGGT to reconstruct object-level 3D assets from RGB images for a reusable geometry library. Execution: Continuously synchronize the digital twin via point cloud segmentation updates and colored-ICP registration; motion planners compute collision-free/dynamically feasible trajectories in simulation, executed via real-to-sim-to-real loop.

Result: Experiments in dynamic and occluded scenes show SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and motion safety.

Conclusion: Digital-twin synchronization is effective for real-world robotic execution in dynamic and occluded environments.

Abstract: Accurate and safe grasping under dynamic and visually occluded conditions remains a core challenge in real-world robotic manipulation. We present SyncTwin, a digital twin framework that unifies fast 3D scene reconstruction and real-to-sim synchronization for robust and safety-aware grasping in such environments. In the offline stage, we employ VGGT to rapidly reconstruct object-level 3D assets from RGB images, forming a reusable geometry library for simulation. During execution, SyncTwin continuously synchronizes the digital twin by tracking real-world object states via point cloud segmentation updates and aligning them through colored-ICP registration. The updated twin enables motion planners to compute collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories in simulation, which are safely executed on the real robot through a closed real-to-sim-to-real loop. Experiments in dynamic and occluded scenes show that SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and motion safety, demonstrating the effectiveness of digital-twin synchronization for real-world robotic execution.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces UMI-FT, a handheld data-collection platform with finger-level F/T sensors, enabling multimodal data collection to train an adaptive compliance policy for force-sensitive manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial F/T sensors have high cost, bulky size and fragility, limiting large-scale, force-aware policy learning for manipulation tasks requiring careful force modulation.

Method: Develop UMI-FT, a handheld platform with compact six-axis F/T sensors on each finger for finger-level wrench measurements alongside RGB, depth, and pose; use collected multimodal data to train an adaptive compliance policy predicting position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for standard compliance controllers.

Result: In evaluations on three contact-rich, force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, lightbulb insertion), UMI-FT enables policies that reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines lacking compliance or force sensing.

Conclusion: UMI-FT offers a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations, with open-sourced hardware and software for broader adoption.

Abstract: Many manipulation tasks require careful force modulation. With insufficient force the task may fail, while excessive force could cause damage. The high cost, bulky size and fragility of commercial force/torque (F/T) sensors have limited large-scale, force-aware policy learning. We introduce UMI-FT, a handheld data-collection platform that mounts compact, six-axis force/torque sensors on each finger, enabling finger-level wrench measurements alongside RGB, depth, and pose. Using the multimodal data collected from this device, we train an adaptive compliance policy that predicts position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for execution on standard compliance controllers. In evaluations on three contact-rich, force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, and lightbulb insertion), UMI-FT enables policies that reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines that lack compliance or force sensing. UMI-FT offers a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations. We open-source the hardware and software to facilitate broader adoption at:https://umi-ft.github.io/.

### [5] [CoCoPlan: Adaptive Coordination and Communication for Multi-robot Systems in Dynamic and Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10116)
*Xintong Zhang,Junfeng Chen,Yuxiao Zhu,Bing Luo,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoCoPlan, a unified framework for multi-robot systems that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication to address suboptimal coordination under limited communication, outperforming SOTA methods in task completion rate, communication overhead, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-robot coordination methods fail to adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, resulting in suboptimal coordination.

Method: CoCoPlan integrates a branch-and-bound architecture encoding task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function balancing task efficiency and communication latency, and a communication event optimization module determining when, where, and how to re-establish global connectivity.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoCoPlan outperforms SOTA methods with 22.4% higher task completion rate, 58.6% reduced communication overhead, and scalability to 100 robots in dynamic environments; hardware experiments include 2D office and 3D disaster-response scenarios.

Conclusion: CoCoPlan effectively addresses the gap in multi-robot coordination under limited communication, achieving superior performance in task efficiency, communication overhead, and scalability.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems can greatly enhance efficiency through coordination and collaboration, yet in practice, full-time communication is rarely available and interactions are constrained to close-range exchanges. Existing methods either maintain all-time connectivity, rely on fixed schedules, or adopt pairwise protocols, but none adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, resulting in suboptimal coordination. To address this gap, we propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication. Our approach integrates a branch-and-bound architecture that jointly encodes task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function that balances task efficiency against communication latency, and a communication event optimization module that strategically determines when, where and how the global connectivity should be re-established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 22.4% higher task completion rate, reducing communication overhead by 58.6%, and improving the scalability by supporting up to 100 robots in dynamic environments. Hardware experiments include the complex 2D office environment and large-scale 3D disaster-response scenario.

*Shuangshan Nors Li,J. Nathan Kutz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework integrating AI-driven disturbance prediction, multi-modal sensor fusion, and hierarchical hardware control to address the conflict between platform mobility and deposition precision in mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain, achieving sub-centimeter accuracy in outdoor experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain faces challenges due to the conflict between platform mobility and deposition precision; existing gantry-based systems have high accuracy but lack mobility, while mobile platforms struggle with print quality on uneven ground.

Method: A closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system is proposed, which tightly integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction (learning terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors for proactive compensation), multi-modal sensor fusion, and a three-layer control architecture (path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, and precision hardware execution).

Result: Outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility.

Conclusion: This AI-hardware integration establishes a practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain remains challenging due to the conflict between platform mobility and deposition precision. Existing gantry-based systems achieve high accuracy but lack mobility, while mobile platforms struggle to maintain print quality on uneven ground. We present a framework that tightly integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with multi-modal sensor fusion and hierarchical hardware control, forming a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system. The AI module learns terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation rather than reactive correction. This intelligence is embedded into a three-layer control architecture: path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, and precision hardware execution. Through outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities, we demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility. This AI-hardware integration establishes a practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments.

TL;DR: 提出一种自动化方法，为任意刚性可折叠结构（RFS）生成Pfaffian约束矩阵，通过构建面-铰链图、提取最小循环基并利用螺旋理论组装速度级约束矩阵，实现多样RFS的展开与折叠运动计算及可视化，消除繁琐易错的约束计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 折纸启发的刚性面板结构已涵盖厚板、剪纸和多层实现，统一运动学分析至关重要，但缺乏整合其回路约束的通用方法。

Method: 基于最小扩展数据模式，构建面-铰链图，提取捕获所有约束的最小循环基，通过螺旋理论组装编码耦合旋转和平移回路闭合的速度级约束矩阵。

Result: 该框架能计算和可视化多样刚性可折叠结构的展开与折叠运动，同时消除繁琐且易错的约束计算。

Conclusion: 提出的自动化方法为任意刚性可折叠结构提供了统一的运动学分析框架，有效解决了回路约束整合问题，提升了运动计算的效率与准确性。

Abstract: Origami-inspired structures with rigid panels now span thick, kirigami, and multi-sheet realizations, making unified kinematic analysis essential. Yet a general method that consolidates their loop constraints has been lacking. We present an automated approach that generates the Pfaffian constraint matrix for arbitrary rigid foldable structures (RFS). From a minimally extended data schema, the tool constructs the facet-hinge graph, extracts a minimum cycle basis that captures all constraints, and assembles a velocity-level constraint matrix via screw theory that encodes coupled rotation and translation loop closure. The framework computes and visualizes deploy and fold motions across diverse RFS while eliminating tedious and error-prone constraint calculations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This work addresses safe and efficient mobile robot navigation in complex dynamic environments with concave moving obstacles by using Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks, and feeding them into quadratic programs with modulated CBFs (MCBFs), outperforming baselines in simulations and real-world experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions.

Method: Using Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning, and feeding the learned barrier functions into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs).

Result: The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline and introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions, achieving safe and efficient navigation in complex dynamic environments with concave moving obstacles.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of safe and efficient mobile robot navigation in complex dynamic environments with concave moving obstacles. Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions. The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.

*Eszter Birtalan,Miklós Koller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究通过仿真评估了6种不同密度和布局的触觉传感器配置对强化学习的影响，识别出一种在两种设置中均表现最佳的配置，为机器人手（包括假肢）设计提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人手设计中触觉传感器的密度和布局差异大，常占用大量空间，需通过评估不同配置对强化学习的影响以优化设计。

Method: 基于不同密度和布局的6种触觉传感器配置，采用两设置系统进行仿真评估，确保结果不依赖特定物理模拟器、机器人手模型或机器学习算法。

Result: 结果显示6种传感器化仿真存在设置特异性及通用效应，识别出一种配置在两种设置中均持续产生最佳性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果可为未来机器人手（包括假肢）设计相关研究提供帮助。

Abstract: Tactile sensors are breaking into the field of robotics to provide direct information related to contact surfaces, including contact events, slip events and even texture identification. These events are especially important for robotic hand designs, including prosthetics, as they can greatly improve grasp stability. Most presently published robotic hand designs, however, implement them in vastly different densities and layouts on the hand surface, often reserving the majority of the available space. We used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, based on their impact on reinforcement learning. Our two-setup system allows for robust results that are not dependent on the use of a given physics simulator, robotic hand model or machine learning algorithm. Our results show setup-specific, as well as generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations, and we identify one configuration as consistently yielding the best performance across both setups. These results could help future research aimed at robotic hand designs, including prostheses.

### [10] [CHORAL: Traversal-Aware Planning for Safe and Efficient Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10340)
*David Morilla-Cabello,Eduardo Montijano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an integrated semantic-aware framework (CHORAL) for coordinating heterogeneous robots to monitor complex environments, which builds a metric-semantic map via open-vocabulary vision models, identifies inspection regions and capability-aware paths, and formulates a heterogeneous vehicle routing problem to assign tasks and compute trajectories, with experiments showing improved safety and efficiency, and the framework is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for coordinating robot teams often assume homogeneous robots or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing, failing to fully integrate scene understanding into routing decisions, thus limiting adaptability and leveraging robot strengths in monitoring large, unknown, complex environments.

Method: The approach starts with a reconnaissance flight to build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models, identifies regions needing closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform, then incorporates these into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation to jointly assign inspection tasks and compute robot trajectories.

Result: Experiments in simulation and a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate that the approach plans safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed integrated semantic-aware framework (CHORAL) effectively coordinates heterogeneous robots for monitoring complex environments, improving mission performance and feasibility, and is released as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams.

Abstract: Monitoring large, unknown, and complex environments with autonomous robots poses significant navigation challenges, where deploying teams of heterogeneous robots with complementary capabilities can substantially improve both mission performance and feasibility. However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them. These are then incorporated into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories. Experiments in simulation and in a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities. We release our framework, CHORAL, as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams.

### [11] [FastStair: Learning to Run Up Stairs with Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10365)
*Yan Liu,Tao Yu,Haolin Song,Hongbo Zhu,Nianzong Hu,Yuzhi Hao,Xiuyong Yao,Xizhe Zang,Hua Chen,Jie Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that combines model-based foothold planning and reinforcement learning to enable humanoid robots to achieve fast and stable stair ascent, with the Oli robot demonstrating stable ascent at speeds up to 1.65 m/s and winning a competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots face challenges in stair running due to conflicting requirements of high agility and strict stability; model-free RL may lead to unsafe behaviors, while model-based planners result in conservative motion limiting speed.

Method: FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into RL training to bias exploration toward feasible contacts and pretrain a safety-focused base policy, then fine-tunes the base policy into speed-specialized experts and integrates them via LoRA for smooth operation across speed ranges.

Result: Deployed on the Oli humanoid robot, it achieved stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s, traversed a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, and won the Canton Tower Robot Run Up Competition.

Conclusion: The FastStair framework reconciles the strengths of model-based planning and reinforcement learning, enabling robust high-speed stair ascent for humanoid robots.

Abstract: Running up stairs is effortless for humans but remains extremely challenging for humanoid robots due to the simultaneous requirements of high agility and strict stability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases. Notably, the proposed approach served as the champion solution in the Canton Tower Robot Run Up Competition.

*He Ren,Gaowei Yan,Hang Liu,Lifeng Cao,Zhijun Zhao,Gang Dang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework to address the gap in digital twin (DT) virtual models, which need high predictive accuracy, interpretability, and online adaptability, by unifying online symbolic discovery as a probabilistic state-space model with sparse horseshoe priors, online recursive algorithm with forgetting factor, and convergence analysis, validated via case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital twins (DTs) require virtual models with high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability, but existing techniques (Bayesian methods lack interpretability; symbolic methods like SINDy are offline/batch-processing) cannot meet these demands simultaneously.

Method: Proposes BRSL framework, formulating online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model, incorporating sparse horseshoe priors to transform model selection into Bayesian inference for simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification; derives online recursive algorithm with forgetting factor, establishes recursive conditions for posterior well-posedness (serving as data utility monitors), and provides convergence analysis under persistent excitation.

Result: Case studies validate the framework's effectiveness in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.

Conclusion: The BRSL framework bridges the gap between existing techniques, enabling DT virtual models to meet the critical requirements of high predictive accuracy, interpretability, and online adaptability.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), serving as the core enablers for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, impose critical requirements on their virtual models: high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.
