Abstract: Introduction: Socially assistive robots hold promise for enhancing therapeutic engagement in paediatric clinical settings. However, their successful implementation requires not only technical robustness but also context-sensitive, co-designed solutions. This paper presents Mobirobot, a socially assistive robot developed to support mobilisation in children recovering from trauma, fractures, or depressive disorders through personalised exercise programmes.
  Methods: An agile, human-centred development approach guided the iterative design of Mobirobot. Multidisciplinary clinical teams and end users were involved throughout the co-development process, which focused on early integration into real-world paediatric surgical and psychiatric settings. The robot, based on the NAO platform, features a simple setup, adaptable exercise routines with interactive guidance, motivational dialogue, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and no-code system feedback.
  Results: Deployment in hospital environments enabled the identification of key design requirements and usability constraints. Stakeholder feedback led to refinements in interaction design, movement capabilities, and technical configuration. A feasibility study is currently underway to assess acceptance, usability, and perceived therapeutic benefit, with data collection including questionnaires, behavioural observations, and staff-patient interviews.
  Discussion: Mobirobot demonstrates how multiprofessional, stakeholder-led development can yield a socially assistive system suited for dynamic inpatient settings. Early-stage findings underscore the importance of contextual integration, robustness, and minimal-intrusion design. While challenges such as sensor limitations and patient recruitment remain, the platform offers a promising foundation for further research and clinical application.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究聚焦动态受限环境中机器人导航，探讨人类运动预测质量对机器人导航性能、人类生产力及印象的影响，通过包含80名受试者的用户研究发现平均位移误差不可靠、人类合作假设失效、机器人导航效率提升常以人类效率和舒适度为代价等关键结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为实现移动机器人在仓库、医院、工厂及家庭等场景中更紧密地与人类融合，需确保机器人具备人类运动模型，而人类行为随机性、用户偏好差异及数据稀缺性使人类运动预测极具挑战。

Method: 设计在受限工作空间中机器人与两名人类受试者的导航场景，在两个不同世界区域的地点，使用两种不同机器人平台进行用户研究（N=80），系统调查人类运动预测质量的影响。

Result: 研究发现：1) 广泛采用的平均位移误差不能可靠预测机器人导航性能和人类印象；2) 在受限环境中，人类合作的常见假设不成立，用户常不回报机器人合作并导致性能下降；3) 更高效的机器人导航往往以人类效率和舒适度为代价。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了动态受限环境下人类运动预测与机器人导航的复杂关系，为相关领域提供了重要的实践启示，即需重新评估现有预测指标和合作假设，平衡机器人与人类的效率及舒适度。

Abstract: Motivated by the vision of integrating mobile robots closer to humans in warehouses, hospitals, manufacturing plants, and the home, we focus on robot navigation in dynamic and spatially constrained environments. Ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency in such settings requires that robots are endowed with a model of how humans move around them. Human motion prediction around robots is especially challenging due to the stochasticity of human behavior, differences in user preferences, and data scarcity. In this work, we perform a methodical investigation of the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, as well as human productivity and impressions. We design a scenario involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace and instantiate it in a user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms, conducted across two sites from different world regions. Key findings include evidence that: 1) the widely adopted average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions; 2) the common assumption of human cooperation breaks down in constrained environments, with users often not reciprocating robot cooperation, and causing performance degradations; 3) more efficient robot navigation often comes at the expense of human efficiency and comfort.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of digital-twin synchronization for real-world robotic execution is demonstrated.

Abstract: Accurate and safe grasping under dynamic and visually occluded conditions remains a core challenge in real-world robotic manipulation. We present SyncTwin, a digital twin framework that unifies fast 3D scene reconstruction and real-to-sim synchronization for robust and safety-aware grasping in such environments. In the offline stage, we employ VGGT to rapidly reconstruct object-level 3D assets from RGB images, forming a reusable geometry library for simulation. During execution, SyncTwin continuously synchronizes the digital twin by tracking real-world object states via point cloud segmentation updates and aligning them through colored-ICP registration. The updated twin enables motion planners to compute collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories in simulation, which are safely executed on the real robot through a closed real-to-sim-to-real loop. Experiments in dynamic and occluded scenes show that SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and motion safety, demonstrating the effectiveness of digital-twin synchronization for real-world robotic execution.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces UMI-FT, a handheld data-collection platform with finger-level F/T sensors, which enables training an adaptive compliance policy for force-sensitive manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines in evaluations and being open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of commercial F/T sensors (high cost, bulky size, fragility) that restrict large-scale force-aware policy learning for manipulation tasks requiring careful force modulation.

Method: Develop UMI-FT, a handheld platform with compact six-axis F/T sensors on each finger to collect multimodal data (RGB, depth, pose, finger-level wrench), then train an adaptive compliance policy predicting position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for standard compliance controllers.

Result: Evaluations on three contact-rich tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, lightbulb insertion) show UMI-FT enables policies to reliably regulate external contact and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines lacking compliance or force sensing.

Conclusion: UMI-FT provides a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations, with open-sourced hardware and software to facilitate broader adoption.

Abstract: Many manipulation tasks require careful force modulation. With insufficient force the task may fail, while excessive force could cause damage. The high cost, bulky size and fragility of commercial force/torque (F/T) sensors have limited large-scale, force-aware policy learning. We introduce UMI-FT, a handheld data-collection platform that mounts compact, six-axis force/torque sensors on each finger, enabling finger-level wrench measurements alongside RGB, depth, and pose. Using the multimodal data collected from this device, we train an adaptive compliance policy that predicts position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for execution on standard compliance controllers. In evaluations on three contact-rich, force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, and lightbulb insertion), UMI-FT enables policies that reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines that lack compliance or force sensing. UMI-FT offers a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations. We open-source the hardware and software to facilitate broader adoption at:https://umi-ft.github.io/.

### [5] [CoCoPlan: Adaptive Coordination and Communication for Multi-robot Systems in Dynamic and Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10116)
*Xintong Zhang,Junfeng Chen,Yuxiao Zhu,Bing Luo,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoCoPlan, a unified framework for multi-robot systems that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication to address suboptimal coordination under limited communication, achieving higher task completion rate, lower communication overhead, and better scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-robot coordination either maintain all-time connectivity, rely on fixed schedules, or adopt pairwise protocols, failing to adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, leading to suboptimal coordination.

Method: CoCoPlan integrates a branch-and-bound architecture encoding task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function balancing task efficiency and communication latency, and a communication event optimization module determining when, where, and how to re-establish global connectivity.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoCoPlan outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 22.4% higher task completion rate, 58.6% reduced communication overhead, and scalability for up to 100 robots in dynamic environments; hardware experiments include 2D office and 3D disaster-response scenarios.

Conclusion: CoCoPlan effectively addresses the gap in multi-robot coordination under limited communication, achieving superior performance in task completion, communication overhead, and scalability.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems can greatly enhance efficiency through coordination and collaboration, yet in practice, full-time communication is rarely available and interactions are constrained to close-range exchanges. Existing methods either maintain all-time connectivity, rely on fixed schedules, or adopt pairwise protocols, but none adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, resulting in suboptimal coordination. To address this gap, we propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication. Our approach integrates a branch-and-bound architecture that jointly encodes task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function that balances task efficiency against communication latency, and a communication event optimization module that strategically determines when, where and how the global connectivity should be re-established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 22.4% higher task completion rate, reducing communication overhead by 58.6%, and improving the scalability by supporting up to 100 robots in dynamic environments. Hardware experiments include the complex 2D office environment and large-scale 3D disaster-response scenario.

### [6] [Terrain-Adaptive Mobile 3D Printing with Hierarchical Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10208)
*Shuangshan Nors Li,J. Nathan Kutz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain by proposing a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation framework integrating AI-driven disturbance prediction, multi-modal sensor fusion, and hierarchical hardware control, achieving sub-centimeter printing accuracy with full platform mobility in outdoor experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conflict between platform mobility and deposition precision in mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain, where existing gantry-based systems lack mobility and mobile platforms struggle with print quality on uneven ground.

Method: A framework integrating AI-driven disturbance prediction (learning terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors for proactive compensation), multi-modal sensor fusion, and a three-layer control architecture (path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, precision hardware execution).

Result: Sub-centimeter printing accuracy was demonstrated while maintaining full platform mobility through outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities.

Conclusion: This AI-hardware integration establishes a practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain remains challenging due to the conflict between platform mobility and deposition precision. Existing gantry-based systems achieve high accuracy but lack mobility, while mobile platforms struggle to maintain print quality on uneven ground. We present a framework that tightly integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with multi-modal sensor fusion and hierarchical hardware control, forming a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system. The AI module learns terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation rather than reactive correction. This intelligence is embedded into a three-layer control architecture: path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, and precision hardware execution. Through outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities, we demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility. This AI-hardware integration establishes a practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments.

Motivation: 折纸启发的刚性面板结构已涵盖厚板、剪纸和多层实现，统一运动学分析至关重要，但缺乏整合其环路约束的通用方法。

Method: 从最小扩展数据模式构建面-铰链图，提取捕获所有约束的最小循环基，通过螺旋理论组装编码耦合旋转和平移环路闭合的速度级约束矩阵。

Result: 该框架能计算和可视化多样刚性可折叠结构的展开与折叠运动，同时消除繁琐且易错的约束计算。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动化方法为任意刚性可折叠结构提供了统一的运动学分析框架，有效解决了环路约束整合问题，提升了约束计算效率与准确性。

Abstract: Origami-inspired structures with rigid panels now span thick, kirigami, and multi-sheet realizations, making unified kinematic analysis essential. Yet a general method that consolidates their loop constraints has been lacking. We present an automated approach that generates the Pfaffian constraint matrix for arbitrary rigid foldable structures (RFS). From a minimally extended data schema, the tool constructs the facet-hinge graph, extracts a minimum cycle basis that captures all constraints, and assembles a velocity-level constraint matrix via screw theory that encodes coupled rotation and translation loop closure. The framework computes and visualizes deploy and fold motions across diverse RFS while eliminating tedious and error-prone constraint calculations.

### [9] [The impact of tactile sensor configurations on grasp learning efficiency -- a comparative evaluation in simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10268)
*Eszter Birtalan,Miklós Koller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 6 tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts on robotic hands via simulations, identifying one consistently best-performing configuration across two setups to aid future robotic hand and prosthesis designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic hand designs implement tactile sensors with varying densities and layouts, often occupying most available space, and there is a need to determine optimal configurations for improving grasp stability.

Method: Simulations were used to evaluate 6 tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, using a two-setup system to ensure results are not dependent on specific physics simulators, robotic hand models, or machine learning algorithms.

Result: The results show setup-specific and generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations, with one configuration consistently yielding the best performance across both setups.

Conclusion: These findings can assist future research in robotic hand designs, including prostheses.

Abstract: Tactile sensors are breaking into the field of robotics to provide direct information related to contact surfaces, including contact events, slip events and even texture identification. These events are especially important for robotic hand designs, including prosthetics, as they can greatly improve grasp stability. Most presently published robotic hand designs, however, implement them in vastly different densities and layouts on the hand surface, often reserving the majority of the available space. We used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, based on their impact on reinforcement learning. Our two-setup system allows for robust results that are not dependent on the use of a given physics simulator, robotic hand model or machine learning algorithm. Our results show setup-specific, as well as generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations, and we identify one configuration as consistently yielding the best performance across both setups. These results could help future research aimed at robotic hand designs, including prostheses.

### [10] [CHORAL: Traversal-Aware Planning for Safe and Efficient Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10340)
*David Morilla-Cabello,Eduardo Montijano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an integrated semantic-aware framework (CHORAL) for coordinating heterogeneous robot teams to monitor large, unknown, complex environments, which builds metric-semantic maps via open-vocabulary vision models, identifies inspection regions and capability-aware paths, and incorporates them into a routing formulation to assign tasks and compute trajectories, with experiments showing improved route safety and efficiency, and the framework is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring large, unknown, complex environments with autonomous robots faces navigation challenges; existing approaches often assume homogeneous teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing, failing to fully integrate scene understanding into routing decisions, limiting adaptability and leveraging robot strengths.

Method: An integrated semantic-aware framework: starting from a reconnaissance flight, build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models, identify regions needing closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform, then incorporate into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation to jointly assign inspection tasks and compute robot trajectories.

Result: Experiments in simulation and a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the approach effectively plans safer and more efficient routes by accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework (CHORAL) supports coordination of heterogeneous robot teams for environment monitoring, with improved performance, and is released as open source to aid reproducibility and deployment.

Abstract: Monitoring large, unknown, and complex environments with autonomous robots poses significant navigation challenges, where deploying teams of heterogeneous robots with complementary capabilities can substantially improve both mission performance and feasibility. However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them. These are then incorporated into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories. Experiments in simulation and in a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities. We release our framework, CHORAL, as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams.

### [11] [FastStair: Learning to Run Up Stairs with Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10365)
*Yan Liu,Tao Yu,Haolin Song,Hongbo Zhu,Nianzong Hu,Yuzhi Hao,Xiuyong Yao,Xizhe Zang,Hua Chen,Jie Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FastStair是一种结合模型规划与强化学习的框架，通过并行模型基立足点规划器引导RL训练，经LoRA整合速度专家策略，使Oli人形机器人实现1.65 m/s稳定上楼，12秒完成33级螺旋楼梯，获广州塔机器人登高赛冠军。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人上楼时高敏捷性与稳定性的矛盾：无模型强化学习（RL）易因隐性稳定奖励和任务特定奖励塑造导致不安全行为，而模型基立足点规划器虽编码接触可行性和稳定性结构，但硬约束常导致保守运动限制速度。

Method: 1. 提出FastStair框架，将并行模型基立足点规划器整合到RL训练循环，引导探索至动态可行接触并预训练安全聚焦的基础策略；2. 缓解规划器保守性及低速与高速动作分布差异，将基础策略微调为速度专用专家，通过LoRA整合以实现全指令速度范围的平滑运行。

Result: 在Oli人形机器人上部署控制器，实现高达1.65 m/s的指令速度稳定上楼，12秒内通过33级螺旋楼梯（每级台阶高17 cm），在长楼梯上展现鲁棒高速性能，并获广州塔机器人登高赛冠军。

Conclusion: FastStair框架通过融合模型规划与强化学习的互补优势，成功实现人形机器人快速稳定的楼梯爬升，在实际竞赛中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Running up stairs is effortless for humans but remains extremely challenging for humanoid robots due to the simultaneous requirements of high agility and strict stability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases. Notably, the proposed approach served as the champion solution in the Canton Tower Robot Run Up Competition.

*He Ren,Gaowei Yan,Hang Liu,Lifeng Cao,Zhijun Zhao,Gang Dang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework to address the challenges existing techniques face in meeting the requirements of digital twins (high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability). The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model, incorporates sparse horseshoe priors for model selection as a Bayesian inference task, derives an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and recursive conditions for posterior well-posedness and data utility monitoring, and provides convergence analysis. Case studies validate its effectiveness in interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital twins require virtual models with high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. Existing techniques like Bayesian methods (good at uncertainty quantification but lack interpretability) and symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy, interpretable but offline/batch-processing, hard for real-time updates) cannot meet these demands simultaneously, creating a semantic and computational gap.

Method: The proposed BRSL framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. It incorporates sparse horseshoe priors to transform model selection into a Bayesian inference task for simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. An online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor is derived, and precise recursive conditions are established to guarantee posterior well-posedness (also acting as real-time data utility monitors). A rigorous convergence analysis under persistent excitation conditions is provided.

Result: Case studies validate the effectiveness of the BRSL framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.

Conclusion: The BRSL framework bridges the gap between existing techniques by enabling simultaneous high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability for digital twin virtual models, with validated effectiveness through case studies.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), serving as the core enablers for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, impose critical requirements on their virtual models: high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.
