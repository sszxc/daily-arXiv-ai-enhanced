Among these, quadruped robots with\nmanipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.\nHowever, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of\nintegrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic\narm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.\nTeleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high\nlevel of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load\non the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that\ndirectly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler\nand more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by\nleveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external\ncamera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist\nposition. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to\ncontrol the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe\nteleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and\nthe robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,\ndemonstrating robust performance in real-time control.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches.
