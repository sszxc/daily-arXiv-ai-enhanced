However, recent work suggests that\nalternative approaches can enable new paradigms for structure formation.\nAleatory architectures, or those which rely on the properties of their granular\nbuilding blocks rather than pre-planned design or computation, have thus far\nrelied on human intervention for their creation. We imagine that robotic swarms\ncould be valuable to create such aleatory structures by manipulating and\nforming structures from entangled granular materials. To discover principles by\nwhich robotic systems can effectively manipulate soft matter, we develop a\nrobophysical model for interaction with geometrically cohesive granular media\ncomposed of u-shape particles. This robotic platform uses environmental signals\nto autonomously coordinate excavation, transport, and deposition of material.\nWe test the effect of substrate initial conditions by characterizing robot\nperformance in two different material compaction states and observe as much as\na 75% change in transported mass depending on initial substrate compressive\nloading. These discrepancies suggest the functional role that material\nproperties such as packing and cohesion/entanglement play in excavation and\nconstruction.

Current control methods,\nsuch as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive,\nenvironmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This\nresearch introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system\ndesigned for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central,\ntree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF\nidentification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest\nneutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field\ndeployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated\nLanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p\n< 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in\ntree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to\nconventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and\nimproved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced\nautonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential\nfor broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative\npotential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species\nmanagement and improved environmental outcomes."}

A critical challenge is the\nagent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its\nobjectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for\nreactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object\nrecognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as\noptical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system\nis grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic\nknowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to\ncreate queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer\nentities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of\nreasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for\nnormal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved\nin particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to\nautonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to\nrecognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible\nby focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach\nin a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects\ninvolved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle\ninitially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it\nlearns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able\nto plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation. This underscores\nthe agent's capability to expand its knowledge through observation in a\nsystematic way, and illustrates the potential of combining deep reasoning\n[...]."}

However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in\ninteractions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex\nmulti-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling\ninteractions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a\ncognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is\nintegrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic\ninteraction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk\nSocial Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused\nmeasure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like\ntrajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a\ndynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a\nSoft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and\ninformed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework\neffectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation\ncompared to the state-of-the-art method."}

For instance, accurately pouring liquid from one\ncontainer to another poses challenges, particularly when models are trained on\nlimited demonstrations and may perform poorly in novel situations. This paper\nproposes an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm designed\nto mitigate these inaccuracies. By incorporating estimates of model\nuncertainty, the proposed MCTS strategy biases the search towards actions with\nlower predicted uncertainty. This approach enhances the reliability of planning\nunder uncertain conditions.

Observational learning enables intuitive human\nskills transfer through hands-on demonstrations, but relying solely on visual\ninput can be inefficient in terms of scalability and failure mitigation,\nespecially when based on a single demonstration. This paper presents a\nhuman-in-the-loop method for enhancing the robot execution plan, automatically\ngenerated based on a single RGB video, with natural language input to a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM). By including user-specified goals or critical task\naspects and exploiting the LLM common-sense reasoning, the system adjusts the\nvision-based plan to prevent potential failures and adapts it based on the\nreceived instructions. Experiments demonstrated the framework intuitiveness and\neffectiveness in correcting vision-derived errors and adapting plans without\nrequiring additional demonstrations.
