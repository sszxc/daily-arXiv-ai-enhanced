However, building versatile embodied agents poses\ncritical challenges due to three key issues: dynamic environment perception,\nopen-ended tool usage, and complex multi-task planning. Most previous works\nrely solely on feedback from tool agents to perceive environmental changes and\ntask status, which limits adaptability to real-time dynamics, causes error\naccumulation, and restricts tool flexibility. Furthermore, multi-task\nscheduling has received limited attention, primarily due to the inherent\ncomplexity of managing task dependencies and balancing competing priorities in\ndynamic and complex environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\n$\\mathcal{P}^3$, a unified framework that integrates real-time perception and\ndynamic scheduling. Specifically, $\\mathcal{P}^3$ enables 1) \\textbf Perceive\nrelevant task information actively from the environment, 2) \\textbf Plug and\nutilize any tool without feedback requirement, and 3) \\textbf Plan multi-task\nexecution based on prioritizing urgent tasks and dynamically adjusting task\norder based on dependencies.

To advance next-generation\nprosthetic hand control design, it is crucial to address current shortcomings\nin robustness to out of lab artifacts, and generalizability to new\nenvironments. Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing\ndatasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered\nin the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects,\nnegatively affecting users' independence and quality of life.\n  To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to\ngeneralize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO,\ndespite 80% training accuracy, drop to 15% on unseen objects. (ii) we propose\nGrasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to\ninfer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object's physical\ncharacteristics resulting in a significant 50.2% accuracy over unseen object\ntypes compared to 36.7% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.\n  Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp\nNetwork (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp\nestimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively\nexpanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC)\nenables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic\nprojection accuracy by 5.6% (to 42.3%) with 3.5x speedup over the unseen object\ntypes.

In these contexts,\ncommunication is often severely limited to short-range exchanges via ad-hoc\nnetworks, posing challenges to coordination. While recent studies have\naddressed multi-robot exploration under communication constraints, they largely\noverlook the essential role of human operators and their real-time interaction\nwith robotic teams.

Conversely, robots may seek human\nconfirmation for anomalous events or require help recovering from motion or\nplanning failures. To enable such bilateral, context-aware interactions under\nrestricted communication, this work proposes MoRoCo, a unified framework for\nonline coordination and exploration in multi-operator, multi-robot systems.\nMoRoCo enables the team to adaptively switch among three coordination modes:\nspread mode for parallelized exploration with intermittent data sharing,\nmigrate mode for coordinated relocation, and chain mode for maintaining\nhigh-bandwidth connectivity through multi-hop links. These transitions are\nmanaged through distributed algorithms via only local communication.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce Risk Map as Middleware (RiskMM) and propose an\ninterpretable cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The risk map learns\ndirectly from the driving data and provides an interpretable spatiotemporal\nrepresentation of the scenario from the upstream perception and the\ninteractions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding environment for\ndownstream planning.

Progress is limited due to the lack of a\ncontrollable and standardized real-world testbed for systematic data collection\nand validation. To fill this gap, we introduce Verti-Arena, a reconfigurable\nindoor facility designed specifically for off-road autonomy. By providing a\nrepeatable benchmark environment, Verti-Arena supports reproducible experiments\nacross a variety of vertically challenging terrains and provides precise ground\ntruth measurements through onboard sensors and a motion capture system.\nVerti-Arena also supports consistent data collection and comparative evaluation\nof algorithms in off-road autonomy research. We also develop a web-based\ninterface that enables research groups worldwide to remotely conduct\nstandardized off-road autonomy experiments on Verti-Arena."}

Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First,\nalthough large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task\nplanning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to\ntabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited\nactuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies\nexhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object\nconfigurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for\npractical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform\nmaneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings\nremains understudied.\n  In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for\nagile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates\nhigh-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the\nchallenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce\na hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling\nlong-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the\ncontrol level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across\nchallenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon\nmobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through\nsuccessful sim-to-real transfer, we demonstrate the system's generalization and\nrobustness in real-world deployments, underscoring the practicality of legged\nmanipulators in unstructured environments.

We address these gaps with BeyondMimic, the first real-world\nframework to learn from human motions for versatile and naturalistic humanoid\ncontrol via guided diffusion. Our framework provides a motion tracking pipeline\ncapable of challenging skills such as jumping spins, sprinting, and cartwheels\nwith state-of-the-art motion quality. Moving beyond mimicking existing motions\nand synthesize novel ones, we further introduce a unified diffusion policy that\nenables zero-shot task-specific control at test time using simple cost\nfunctions. Deployed on hardware, BeyondMimic performs diverse tasks at test\ntime, including waypoint navigation, joystick teleoperation, and obstacle\navoidance, bridging sim-to-real motion tracking and flexible synthesis of human\nmotion primitives for whole-body control. https://beyondmimic.github.io/."}
