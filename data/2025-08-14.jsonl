Calibrated Prediction of Safety Chances for Image-Controlled Autonomy", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical\nchallenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and\ndistribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited\nin scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while\nmodel-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses\nthese limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction\nin end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition\nmodel nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of\nworld models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to\nforecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the\nprobability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic\nand composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to\nquantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from\nhigh-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator\ncan deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding\nprediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to\nmiscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised\ndomain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution\nshift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides\ntheoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across\nlong prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that\nour UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower\nfalse positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based\ncomposite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon\ntasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds."}

These planners define desired end-effector and joint\ntrajectories, which are used to construct CLF-based rewards that penalize\ntracking error and encourage rapid convergence.

However, this two-stage decomposition framework\nsuffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each\nstage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the\nquality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,\nwe propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE\npolicy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and\nplanning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional\ndiffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future\nactions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint\npredictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible\ninstruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in\nimitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation\ntasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory\naugmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy.

The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object\nsize estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language\nmodel (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size\nestimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial\nparameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based\nrefinement and improving the overall estimation speed.

We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which\nthe reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique\nriver segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov\nDecision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which\nrefines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline\ncomputed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage\nestimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in\nnon-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on\npatchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and\ndata-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent\nvision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics\nEstimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM\nfor cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of\nsolving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.\nSimulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and\nsuperior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized\nAdvantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions\nthat enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,\nCADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the\nLagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during\ntraining, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard\naction overlay."}

We\nintroduce Masquerade, a method that edits in-the-wild egocentric human videos\nto bridge the visual embodiment gap between humans and robots and then learns a\nrobot policy with these edited videos. Our pipeline turns each human video into\nrobotized demonstrations by (i) estimating 3-D hand poses, (ii) inpainting the\nhuman arms, and (iii) overlaying a rendered bimanual robot that tracks the\nrecovered end-effector trajectories. Pre-training a visual encoder to predict\nfuture 2-D robot keypoints on 675K frames of these edited clips, and continuing\nthat auxiliary loss while fine-tuning a diffusion policy head on only 50 robot\ndemonstrations per task, yields policies that generalize significantly better\nthan prior work. On three long-horizon, bimanual kitchen tasks evaluated in\nthree unseen scenes each, Masquerade outperforms baselines by 5-6x. Ablations\nshow that both the robot overlay and co-training are indispensable, and\nperformance scales logarithmically with the amount of edited human video. These\nresults demonstrate that explicitly closing the visual embodiment gap unlocks a\nvast, readily available source of data from human videos that can be used to\nimprove robot policies."}
