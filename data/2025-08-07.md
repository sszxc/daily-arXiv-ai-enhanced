### [1] [Uncertainty-aware Accurate Elevation Modeling for Off-road Navigation via Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03890)
*Sanghun Jung,Daehoon Gwak,Byron Boots,James Hays*

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Terrain elevation modeling for off-road navigation aims to accurately
estimate changes in terrain geometry in real-time and quantify the
corresponding uncertainties. Having precise estimations and uncertainties plays
a crucial role in planning and control algorithms to explore safe and reliable
maneuver strategies. However, existing approaches, such as Gaussian Processes
(GPs) and neural network-based methods, often fail to meet these needs. They
are either unable to perform in real-time due to high computational demands,
underestimating sharp geometry changes, or harming elevation accuracy when
learned with uncertainties. Recently, Neural Processes (NPs) have emerged as a
promising approach that integrates the Bayesian uncertainty estimation of GPs
with the efficiency and flexibility of neural networks. Inspired by NPs, we
propose an effective NP-based method that precisely estimates sharp elevation
changes and quantifies the corresponding predictive uncertainty without losing
elevation accuracy. Our method leverages semantic features from LiDAR and
camera sensors to improve interpolation and extrapolation accuracy in
unobserved regions. Also, we introduce a local ball-query attention mechanism
to effectively reduce the computational complexity of global attention by 17\%
while preserving crucial local and spatial information. We evaluate our method
on off-road datasets having interesting geometric features, collected from
trails, deserts, and hills. Our results demonstrate superior performance over
baselines and showcase the potential of neural processes for effective and
expressive terrain modeling in complex off-road environments.

### [2] [Constraint-Preserving Data Generation for Visuomotor Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03944)
*Kevin Lin,Varun Ragunath,Andrew McAlinden,Aaditya Prasad,Jimmy Wu,Yuke Zhu,Jeannette Bohg*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CP-Gen利用单条专家轨迹生成包含新物体几何和姿态的机器人演示数据，训练出的策略在真实世界中零样本迁移且泛化能力强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模机器人演示数据收集成本高且耗时，需要一种高效的数据生成方法。

Method: 通过将机器人技能建模为关键点轨迹约束，生成新演示数据，并优化机器人关节配置以实现关键点跟踪。

Result: 在16个仿真任务和4个真实任务中，CP-Gen训练的策略平均成功率为77%，优于基线方法的50%。

Conclusion: CP-Gen是一种高效的数据生成方法，能显著提升机器人策略的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot
manipulation, but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. We
present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a
single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel
object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train
closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and
generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior
work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert
demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those
works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as
keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must
track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To
generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for
each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its
associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint
configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the
transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to
the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and
four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and
tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve
an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves
an average of 50%.

Motivation: 滑模控制参数的选择对系统性能和鲁棒性至关重要，但传统方法难以确定最优参数。

Method: 结合遗传算法和滑模控制，自动寻找最优参数。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法比传统滑模控制和模糊滑模控制具有更好的跟踪能力和更小的抖动效应。

Conclusion: 遗传算法优化滑模控制参数是一种高效的方法，适用于不确定和干扰条件下的机器人控制。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for optimizing the sliding mode control (SMC)
parameter for a robot manipulator applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The
objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the
trajectory of the robot manipulator under uncertain and disturbed conditions.
However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the
SMC parameters, which is a difficult and crucial task. To solve this problem, a
genetic algorithm is used to locate the optimal values of these parameters that
gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with
the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the
genetic algorithm with SMC can achieve better tracking capability and reduce
the chattering effect.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCOUT系统通过创新的闭环气体循环设计，实现了对瘤胃甲烷浓度的高分辨率连续监测，显著优于传统环境采样方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确测量肠道甲烷排放是推动畜牧业可持续性的关键瓶颈，现有方法存在数据保留率低、环境干扰和时间分辨率有限的问题。

Method: 开发了SCOUT系统，通过闭环气体循环设计进行连续监测，并在两种饮食处理的牛身上进行了验证。

Result: SCOUT数据保留率达82%，甲烷浓度检测比传统方法高100-1000倍，揭示了行为与排放的新关联。

Conclusion: SCOUT系统为基因组选择和精准畜牧业提供了重要工具，推动了可持续畜牧业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate measurement of enteric methane emissions remains a critical
bottleneck for advancing livestock sustainability through genetic selection and
precision management. Existing ambient sampling approaches suffer from low data
retention rates, environmental interference, and limited temporal resolution.
We developed SCOUT (Smart Cannula-mounted Optical Unit for Trace-methane), the
first robust in-vivo sensing system enabling continuous, high-resolution
monitoring of ruminal methane concentrations through an innovative closed-loop
gas recirculation design. We conducted comprehensive validation with two
cannulated Simmental heifers under contrasting dietary treatments, with
cross-platform comparison against established ambient sniffer systems. SCOUT
achieved exceptional performance with 82% data retention compared to 17% for
conventional sniffer systems, while capturing methane concentrations 100-1000x
higher than ambient approaches. Cross-platform validation demonstrated strong
scale-dependent correlations, with optimal correlation strength (r = -0.564
$\pm$ 0.007) at biologically relevant 40-minute windows and 100% statistical
significance. High-frequency monitoring revealed novel behavior-emission
coupling, including rapid concentration changes (14.5 $\pm$ 11.3k ppm)
triggered by postural transitions within 15 minutes, insights previously
inaccessible through existing technologies. The SCOUT system represents a
transformative advancement, enabling accurate, continuous emission phenotyping
essential for genomic selection programs and sustainable precision livestock
management. This validation framework establishes new benchmarks for
agricultural sensor performance while generating unprecedented biological
insights into ruminal methane dynamics, contributing essential tools for
sustainable livestock production in climate-conscious agricultural systems.

### [5] [DRIVE: Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified Evaluation for Constraint-Aware Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04066)
*Longling Geng,Huangxing Li,Viktor Lado Naess,Mert Pilanci*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DRIVE框架通过动态规则推断和验证评估，从专家演示中建模和评估人类驾驶约束，实现安全且社会合规的自动驾驶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中，软约束通常是隐式、依赖上下文的，难以明确指定，因此需要一种方法来建模和验证这些约束。

Method: DRIVE结合指数族似然建模和凸优化规划，生成动态可行且符合人类偏好的轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，DRIVE在多种驾驶场景中实现了0.0%的软约束违反率，轨迹更平滑，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: DRIVE框架高效、可解释且鲁棒，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and
socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often
implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work,
we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified
Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert
demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to
estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic
representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts.
These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex
optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories
that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human
preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or
purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly
couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both
data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification.
We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD,
highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint
learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves
0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger
generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further
demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for
real-world deployment.

NVIDIA's cuRobo library into Vention's modular automation platform. By
leveraging accurate CAD-based digital twins and real-time parallel
optimization, our system enables rapid trajectory generation and dynamic
collision avoidance for pick-and-place tasks. We demonstrate this capability on
robots equipped with additional degrees of freedom, including a 7th-axis
gantry, and benchmark performance across various scenarios. The results show
significant improvements in planning speed and robustness, highlighting the
potential of GPU-based planning pipelines for scalable, adaptable deployment in
modern industrial workflows.

### [7] [Improving Tactile Gesture Recognition with Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04338)
*Shaohong Zhong,Alessandro Albini,Giammarco Caroleo,Giorgio Cannata,Perla Maiolino*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通过计算密集光流增强触觉图像动态信息，提升触觉手势识别准确率9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉图像单独提供的信息难以区分某些手势，需增强动态接触信息以提高分类准确性。

Result: 使用光流增强的触觉图像训练的分类器，手势识别准确率提升9%。

Conclusion: 通过增强触觉图像的动态信息，显著提升了手势识别的准确性。

Abstract: Tactile gesture recognition systems play a crucial role in Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) by enabling intuitive communication between humans and
robots. The literature mainly addresses this problem by applying machine
learning techniques to classify sequences of tactile images encoding the
pressure distribution generated when executing the gestures. However, some
gestures can be hard to differentiate based on the information provided by
tactile images alone. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective way to
improve the accuracy of a gesture recognition classifier. Our approach focuses
solely on processing the tactile images used as input by the classifier. In
particular, we propose to explicitly highlight the dynamics of the contact in
the tactile image by computing the dense optical flow. This additional
information makes it easier to distinguish between gestures that produce
similar tactile images but exhibit different contact dynamics. We validate the
proposed approach in a tactile gesture recognition task, showing that a
classifier trained on tactile images augmented with optical flow information
achieved a 9% improvement in gesture classification accuracy compared to one
trained on standard tactile images.

### [8] [Tactile Comfort: Lowering Heart Rate Through Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04372)
*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy,Maja Matarić*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了一种无需预先训练即可降低儿童心率的袖珍伴侣机器人，通过触觉游戏分散注意力，显著降低心率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有焦虑管理策略需要预先训练，研究旨在开发一种即时有效的放松工具。

Result: 使用机器人显著降低儿童心率（p<0.01），显示一致镇静效果。

Conclusion: 触觉伴侣机器人可增强放松技术的治疗效果。

Abstract: Children diagnosed with anxiety disorders are taught a range of strategies to
navigate situations of heightened anxiety. Techniques such as deep breathing
and repetition of mantras are commonly employed, as they are known to be
calming and reduce elevated heart rates. Although these strategies are often
effective, their successful application relies on prior training of the
children for successful use when faced with challenging situations. This paper
investigates a pocket-sized companion robot designed to offer a relaxation
technique requiring no prior training, with a focus on immediate impact on the
user's heart rate. The robot utilizes a tactile game to divert the user's
attention, thereby promoting relaxation. We conducted two studies with children
who were not diagnosed with anxiety: a 14-day pilot study with two children
(age 8) and a main study with 18 children (ages 7-8). Both studies employed a
within-subjects design and focused on measuring heart rate during tactile
interaction with the robot and during non-use. Interacting with the robot was
found to significantly lower the study participants' heart rate (p$<$0.01)
compared to the non-use condition, indicating a consistent calming effect
across all participants. These results suggest that tactile companion robots
have the potential to enhance the therapeutic value of relaxation techniques.

### [9] [Incorporating Stochastic Models of Controller Behavior into Kinodynamic Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices for Mobile Robot Motion Planning in Off-Road Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04384)
*Eric R. Damm,Eli S. Lancaster,Felix A. Sanchez,Kiana Bronder,Jason M. Gregory,Thomas M. Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出三种方法将随机控制器行为纳入KEASL规划器的重组搜索空间，以解决物理机器人运动中的误差问题。实验表明，该方法能生成更保守的轨迹，降低碰撞概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理机器人运动规划中，理论模型因现实物理和控制误差存在预测不准的问题，需改进。

Method: 在KEASL规划器中引入随机控制器行为的三种方法，并在UGV上进行实验验证。

Result: 随机控制器采样使轨迹更保守，降低碰撞概率，但基线规划成功率下降。

Conclusion: 结合随机控制器行为的KEASL规划器能有效减少碰撞风险，但需权衡规划成功率。

Abstract: Mobile robot motion planners rely on theoretical models to predict how the
robot will move through the world. However, when deployed on a physical robot,
these models are subject to errors due to real-world physics and uncertainty in
how the lower-level controller follows the planned trajectory. In this work, we
address this problem by presenting three methods of incorporating stochastic
controller behavior into the recombinant search space of the Kinodynamic
Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL) planner. To demonstrate this work,
we analyze the results of experiments performed on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog
Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in an off-road, unstructured environment using
two different perception algorithms, and performed an ablation study using a
full spectrum of simulated environment map complexities. Analysis of the data
found that incorporating stochastic controller sampling into KEASL leads to
more conservative trajectories that decrease predicted collision likelihood
when compared to KEASL without sampling. When compared to baseline planning
with expanded obstacle footprints, the predicted likelihood of collisions
becomes more comparable, but reduces the planning success rate for baseline
search.

*Yujia Lu,Chong Wei,Lu Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合轨迹规划框架，结合学习方法和优化方法，实现高效安全的自动驾驶高速公路行驶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速公路驾驶环境变化快且反应时间有限，需要可靠且高效的轨迹规划。

Method: 采用双层架构：上层用图神经网络预测速度，下层用混合整数二次规划优化路径。

Result: 在复杂紧急场景中生成平滑无碰撞轨迹，成功率超97%，平均规划时间54毫秒。

Conclusion: 框架兼具实时性和安全性，适用于高速公路自动驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous highway driving presents a high collision risk due to
fast-changing environments and limited reaction time, necessitating reliable
and efficient trajectory planning. This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory
planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods
with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The
framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph
neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like
longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization
formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary
contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a
linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce
computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping
constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning
horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly
smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios,
achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms,
thereby confirming real-time capability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于行为熵的多机器人自适应路径规划框架（BAPP），用于高风险环境中的自主危险地图构建，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在高风险、易故障、通信受限环境中（如灾后区域、地下矿井等）的自主探索和地图构建问题。

Method: 提出了行为熵（BE）概念，扩展了香农熵（SE），并设计了BAPP框架，包含两种算法：BAPP-TID（智能触发高保真机器人）和BAPP-SIG（高风险下的安全部署）。

Result: BAPP框架在单机器人和多机器人模拟中表现优异，BAPP-TID加速熵减，BAPP-SIG提高机器人存活率且信息损失最小。

Conclusion: 行为自适应规划在复杂高风险环境中具有显著优势，能够实现鲁棒且风险敏感的探索。

Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in
high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as
post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these
missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of
failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a
behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot
teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes
Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations.
Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning
(BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a
tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms:
BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for
safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the
informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness
through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that
the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies:
BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot
survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent
deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base
relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value
of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in
complex, failure-prone environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$NavA^3$的分层框架，用于解决复杂开放场景中的长时程导航任务，结合全局和局部策略，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航任务局限于预定义对象或指令跟随，无法满足真实场景中复杂开放需求，因此需要一种能理解高级指令并实现空间感知导航的方法。

Method: 采用分层框架，全局策略利用Reasoning-VLM解析指令并整合3D场景视图；局部策略通过NaviAfford模型（基于1.0百万样本数据集）实现开放词汇对象定位。

Result: $NavA^3$在导航性能上达到SOTA，能成功完成不同机器人实体的长时程导航任务。

Conclusion: $NavA^3$为通用导航提供了新方向，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability of embodied intelligence,
enabling robots to move and interact within physical environments. However,
existing navigation tasks primarily focus on predefined object navigation or
instruction following, which significantly differs from human needs in
real-world scenarios involving complex, open-ended scenes. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a challenging long-horizon navigation task that requires
understanding high-level human instructions and performing spatial-aware object
navigation in real-world environments. Existing embodied navigation methods
struggle with such tasks due to their limitations in comprehending high-level
human instructions and localizing objects with an open vocabulary. In this
paper, we propose $NavA^3$, a hierarchical framework divided into two stages:
global and local policies. In the global policy, we leverage the reasoning
capabilities of Reasoning-VLM to parse high-level human instructions and
integrate them with global 3D scene views. This allows us to reason and
navigate to regions most likely to contain the goal object. In the local
policy, we have collected a dataset of 1.0 million samples of spatial-aware
object affordances to train the NaviAfford model (PointingVLM), which provides
robust open-vocabulary object localization and spatial awareness for precise
goal identification and navigation in complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that $NavA^3$ achieves SOTA results in navigation
performance and can successfully complete longhorizon navigation tasks across
different robot embodiments in real-world settings, paving the way for
universal embodied navigation. The dataset and code will be made available.

Abstract: Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving
events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor
performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical
situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world
driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we
develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios
(HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced
environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we
introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder
(I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn
real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental
deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios.
Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving
performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art
results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further
demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk
driving scenarios. Project page: https://stars79689.github.io/RoboTron-Sim/

TL;DR: OSG Navigator是一个基于基础模型的模块化系统，用于开放世界中的目标导航，通过Open Scene Graph表示空间信息，并在新环境中实现零样本适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放世界语义导航的挑战，即在新环境中根据自然语言指令搜索目标物体。

Method: 使用Open Scene Graph作为空间记忆，通过OSG模式层次化组织空间信息，这些模式可以从简单的语义标签自动生成。

Result: 在Fetch和Spot机器人上的实验表明，OSG Navigator在ObjectNav基准测试中达到最先进性能，并能零样本适应多样目标、环境和机器人形态。

Conclusion: OSG Navigator通过结合基础模型和Open Scene Graph，实现了开放世界目标导航的高效和适应性。

Abstract: How can we build general-purpose robot systems for open-world semantic
navigation, e.g., searching a novel environment for a target object specified
in natural language? To tackle this challenge, we introduce OSG Navigator, a
modular system composed of foundation models, for open-world Object-Goal
Navigation (ObjectNav). Foundation models provide enormous semantic knowledge
about the world, but struggle to organise and maintain spatial information
effectively at scale. Key to OSG Navigator is the Open Scene Graph
representation, which acts as spatial memory for OSG Navigator. It organises
spatial information hierarchically using OSG schemas, which are templates, each
describing the common structure of a class of environments. OSG schemas can be
automatically generated from simple semantic labels of a given environment,
e.g., "home" or "supermarket". They enable OSG Navigator to adapt zero-shot to
new environment types. We conducted experiments using both Fetch and Spot
robots in simulation and in the real world, showing that OSG Navigator achieves
state-of-the-art performance on ObjectNav benchmarks and generalises zero-shot
over diverse goals, environments, and robot embodiments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多智能体机器人系统（MARS）在实际部署中的性能权衡，通过两项模拟医疗场景实验，分析了协调失败和改进通信结构的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多智能体框架技术先进，但其在机器人上的实际应用仍有限，阻碍了MARS研究的进展。

Method: 研究1使用CrewAI迭代优化知识库，识别协调失败；研究2使用AutoGen评估双向通信结构，比较推理与非推理模型。

Result: 研究发现自主性与稳定性之间的张力，强调边缘案例测试对系统可靠性和安全性的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来MARS的实际部署提供了改进方向，强调了系统测试和通信结构优化的必要性。

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by
integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of
action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of
advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains
limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this
gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of
hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot
healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the
system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination
failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure
reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,
using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure
and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models
operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical
findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the
importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for
future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task
agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and
reasoning behaviors, are available at:

Abstract: Accurate system identification is crucial for reducing trajectory drift in
bipedal locomotion, particularly in reinforcement learning and model-based
control. In this paper, we present a novel control framework that integrates
system identification into the reinforcement learning training loop using
differentiable simulation. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on direct
torque measurements, our method estimates system parameters using only
trajectory data (positions, velocities) and control inputs. We leverage the
differentiable simulator MuJoCo-XLA to optimize system parameters, ensuring
that simulated robot behavior closely aligns with real-world motion. This
framework enables scalable and flexible parameter optimization. Accurate system

MuJoCo-XLA to optimize system parameters, ensuring that simulated robot
behavior closely aligns with real-world motion. This framework enables scalable
and flexible parameter optimization. It supports fundamental physical
properties such as mass and inertia. Additionally, it handles complex system
nonlinear behaviors, including advanced friction models, through neural network
approximations. Experimental results show that our framework significantly
improves trajectory following.
