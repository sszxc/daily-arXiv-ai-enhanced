Like the Jacob's\nLadder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible\ncables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner\nreminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by\nmotor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the\nopposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A\nphysics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to\nelucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle\nclearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a\nmaximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second.

However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon\ntasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation\nremains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies.\nIn this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model\nspecifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a\nnovel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask\ninto moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on\nphase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified\nstrategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our\narchitecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA\nmodels. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate\nlong-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and\nreal-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic\ncontrol."}

Jekel", "Alejandro Díaz Rosales", "Luka Peternel"], "title": "Visio-Verbal Teleimpedance Interface: Enabling Semi-Autonomous Control of Physical Interaction via Eye Tracking and Speech", "comment": null, "summary": "The paper presents a visio-verbal teleimpedance interface for commanding 3D\nstiffness ellipsoids to the remote robot with a combination of the operator's\ngaze and verbal interaction. The gaze is detected by an eye-tracker, allowing\nthe system to understand the context in terms of what the operator is currently\nlooking at in the scene. Along with verbal interaction, a Visual Language Model\n(VLM) processes this information, enabling the operator to communicate their\nintended action or provide corrections. Based on these inputs, the interface\ncan then generate appropriate stiffness matrices for different physical\ninteraction actions. To validate the proposed visio-verbal teleimpedance\ninterface, we conducted a series of experiments on a setup including a Force\nDimension Sigma.7 haptic device to control the motion of the remote Kuka LBR\niiwa robotic arm. The human operator's gaze is tracked by Tobii Pro Glasses 2,\nwhile human verbal commands are processed by a VLM using GPT-4o. The first\nexperiment explored the optimal prompt configuration for the interface. The\nsecond and third experiments demonstrated different functionalities of the\ninterface on a slide-in-the-groove task."}

Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies\ncapable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we\nintroduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual\ndexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement\nlearning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand\nmotions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors.\nSubsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth\nimage-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world\nscenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and\nunstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a\nclosed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise\nalignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and\ndexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES\nconsistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild\nscenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous\nmanipulation tasks.

In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer\nhigher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in\npoor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the\nlimitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that\nintegrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models.\nThe resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key\ncharacteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into\ntractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines\ndiscrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide\ndiffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and\n(3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure\ntrajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art\nperformance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while\nachieving planning efficiency and high success rates."}
