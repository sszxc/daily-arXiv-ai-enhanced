A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature\nand determine the sensor orientation.

Central innovations include flexible agents dynamically\nadapting their roles, retrieval-augmented generation utilising vector databases\nfor efficient knowledge management, reinforcement learning-driven behavioural\noptimisation, and autonomous on-the-fly ROS 2 node generation for runtime\nfunctional extensibility. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates UROSA's\npromising adaptability and reliability through realistic underwater missions in\nsimulation and real-world deployments, showing significant advantages over\ntraditional rule-based architectures in handling unforeseen scenarios,\nenvironmental uncertainties, and novel mission objectives. This work not only\nadvances underwater autonomy but also establishes a scalable, safe, and\nversatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse\narray of real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "UROSA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eROS 2\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fAI\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u6c34\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM AI\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UROSA\u4e3a\u6c34\u4e0b\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
