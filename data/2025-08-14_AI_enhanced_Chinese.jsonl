Calibrated Prediction of Safety Chances for Image-Controlled Autonomy", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical\nchallenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and\ndistribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited\nin scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while\nmodel-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses\nthese limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction\nin end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition\nmodel nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of\nworld models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to\nforecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the\nprobability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic\nand composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to\nquantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from\nhigh-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator\ncan deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding\nprediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to\nmiscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised\ndomain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution\nshift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides\ntheoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across\nlong prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that\nour UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower\nfalse positive rates under distribution shift.

However, this two-stage decomposition framework\nsuffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each\nstage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the\nquality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,\nwe propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE\npolicy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and\nplanning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional\ndiffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future\nactions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint\npredictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible\ninstruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in\nimitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation\ntasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory\naugmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This\napproach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to\nrecover from error states.

This framework combines\nwhole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial\nparameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this\nwork. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object\nsize estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language\nmodel (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size\nestimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial\nparameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based\nrefinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy\nfirst estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size\nto ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis\nscheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in\nparallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online\nupdates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled\nhumanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion\nand manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for\ndynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By\ncompensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework\nalso improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior.

Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics\nEstimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM\nfor cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of\nsolving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.\nSimulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and\nsuperior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized\nAdvantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions\nthat enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,\nCADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the\nLagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during\ntraining, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard\naction overlay.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6cb3\u6d41\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u6a21\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u8986\u76d6\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728GPS\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u6cb3\u6d41\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6cb3\u6d41\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5bf9\u6551\u63f4\u3001\u76d1\u89c6\u548c\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u8fb9\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MGAE\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08SDM\uff09\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u6f14\u5458\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08CADE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "MGAE\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bSDM\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff1bCADE\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5b50\u6a21\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We\nintroduce Masquerade, a method that edits in-the-wild egocentric human videos\nto bridge the visual embodiment gap between humans and robots and then learns a\nrobot policy with these edited videos. Our pipeline turns each human video into\nrobotized demonstrations by (i) estimating 3-D hand poses, (ii) inpainting the\nhuman arms, and (iii) overlaying a rendered bimanual robot that tracks the\nrecovered end-effector trajectories. Pre-training a visual encoder to predict\nfuture 2-D robot keypoints on 675K frames of these edited clips, and continuing\nthat auxiliary loss while fine-tuning a diffusion policy head on only 50 robot\ndemonstrations per task, yields policies that generalize significantly better\nthan prior work. On three long-horizon, bimanual kitchen tasks evaluated in\nthree unseen scenes each, Masquerade outperforms baselines by 5-6x. Ablations\nshow that both the robot overlay and co-training are indispensable, and\nperformance scales logarithmically with the amount of edited human video.
