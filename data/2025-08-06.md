### [1] [Learning User Interaction Forces using Vision for a Soft Finger Exosuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02870)
*Mohamed Irfan Refai,Abdulaziz Y. Alkayas,Anup Teejo Mathew,Federico Renda,Thomas George Thuruthel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像和学习的框架，用于估计手指外骨骼系统的分布式接触力，并验证了其在闭环控制中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于软性可穿戴辅助设备的非线性和顺应性特性，物理建模和嵌入式传感具有挑战性，需要一种非侵入式的方法来实时估计接触力。

Method: 使用SoRoSim工具箱生成多样化的外骨骼几何和驱动场景数据集，通过低分辨率灰度图像训练学习模型。

Result: 模型能够准确估计多个接触点的相互作用力，泛化能力强，且在视觉噪声和对比度变化下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该视觉估计器可作为闭环控制的替代力传感器，为非侵入式实时力估计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Wearable assistive devices are increasingly becoming softer. Modelling their
interface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic
assistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical
modeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a
image-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces
for a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse
dataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method
accurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from
low-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and
actuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast
variations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that
the vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for
closed-loop control. This approach could be used as a non-intrusive alternative
for real-time force estimation for exosuits.

### [2] [Tunable Leg Stiffness in a Monopedal Hopper for Energy-Efficient Vertical Hopping Across Varying Ground Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02873)
*Rongqian Chen,Jun Kwon,Kefan Wu,Wei-Hsi Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HASTA是一种具有实时可调腿部刚度的垂直跳跃机器人，旨在优化不同地面条件下的能量效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过调整腿部刚度，最大化跳跃高度，以实现能量高效的垂直跳跃。

Method: 通过实验测试和模拟，找到每种地面刚度和阻尼组合下的最佳腿部刚度。

Result: 结果表明，可调刚度在受控实验条件下提高了能量效率。

Conclusion: 可调刚度有助于能量高效的运动，并为未来控制器开发提供了见解。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable
Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time
tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various
ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By
adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric
for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform
better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while
stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and
energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the
best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground
stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state
hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our
hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in
controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides
insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting
leg stiffness.

### [3] [Co-designing Zoomorphic Robot Concepts for Animal Welfare Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02898)
*Isobel Voysey,Lynne Baillie,Joanne Williams,Michael Herrmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过定制机器人促进儿童动物福利教育，通过参与式设计工作坊收集需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物福利教育需要定制机器人帮助儿童学习动物行为，促进安全互动。

Method: 与教育者和儿童进行参与式设计工作坊，分析机器人外观、行为和功能需求。

Result: 发现儿童对不良行为的负面反应、动物状态信号（面部和尾巴）及自然外观的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了新颖的设计活动，并探讨了达成共识的挑战。

Abstract: Animal welfare education could greatly benefit from customized robots to help
children learn about animals and their behavior, and thereby promote positive,
safe child-animal interactions. To this end, we ran Participatory Design
workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key
requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings
encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as
concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and
contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to
undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to
provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry
appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for
Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by
thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of
the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite
much overlap in their design concepts.

### [4] [Context-aware Risk Assessment and Its Application in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02919)
*Boyang Tian,Weisong Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CRI框架通过实时风险评估和自适应行为提升自动驾驶安全性，显著减少碰撞率并提高驾驶评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险评估方法缺乏解释性或未实际集成到自动驾驶系统中，CRI旨在解决这些问题。

Method: CRI结合方向感知空间分区、RSS原则、混合概率-最大融合策略和自适应控制策略。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CRI显著减少碰撞率（19%车辆碰撞/失败路线，20%碰撞/公里）并提高驾驶评分。

Conclusion: CRI在复杂高风险环境中显著提升安全性和鲁棒性，同时保持模块化和低运行时开销。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk
assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs
coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes
indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses
narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk
Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks
based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting
control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning
within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)
principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation,
and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate
CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using
a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our
collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions
per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a
17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically
significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6
ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially
improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while
maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.

### [5] [Model-agnostic Meta-learning for Adaptive Gait Phase and Terrain Geometry Estimation with Wearable Soft Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02930)
*Zenan Zhu,Wenxi Chen,Pei-Chun Kao,Janelle Clark,Lily Behnke,Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio,Holly Yanco,Yan Gu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MAML的框架，用于通过织物传感器同时准确估计步态和地形，适应性强且泛化能力高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决织物传感器因非线性、个体差异和地形变化带来的估计挑战。

Method: 将MAML集成到深度学习架构中，学习通用模型初始化，实现高效适应和强泛化。

Result: 在九名参与者的实验中，框架在步态、运动模式和倾斜角估计上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在准确性和适应性方面表现出色，适用于不同个体和地形。

Abstract: This letter presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework
for simultaneous and accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain
geometry using a small set of fabric-based wearable soft sensors, with
efficient adaptation to unseen subjects and strong generalization across
different subjects and terrains. Compared to rigid alternatives such as
inertial measurement units, fabric-based soft sensors improve comfort but
introduce nonlinearities due to hysteresis, placement error, and fabric
deformation. Moreover, inter-subject and inter-terrain variability, coupled
with limited calibration data in real-world deployments, further complicate
accurate estimation. To address these challenges, the proposed framework
integrates MAML into a deep learning architecture to learn a generalizable
model initialization that captures subject- and terrain-invariant structure.
This initialization enables efficient adaptation (i.e., adaptation with only a
small amount of calibration data and a few fine-tuning steps) to new users,
while maintaining strong generalization (i.e., high estimation accuracy across
subjects and terrains). Experiments on nine participants walking at various
speeds over five terrain conditions demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms baseline approaches in estimating gait phase, locomotion mode, and
incline angle, with superior accuracy, adaptation efficiency, and
generalization.

### [6] [AeroSafe: Mobile Indoor Air Purification using Aerosol Residence Time Analysis and Robotic Cough Emulator Testbed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02947)
*M Tanjid Hasan Tonmoy,Rahath Malladi,Kaustubh Singh,Forsad Al Hossain,Rajesh Gupta,Andrés E. Tejada-Martínez,Tauhidur Rahman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AeroSafe 是一种通过机器人咳嗽模拟器和数字孪生技术提升室内空气净化系统效能的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前便携式空气过滤器常忽视咳嗽产生的气溶胶浓度，尤其在医疗和公共场所存在风险。

Method: 使用机器人双代理物理模拟器（模拟咳嗽和空气净化器响应）和数字孪生模型（结合物理模型与LSTM网络）。

Result: 模型预测气溶胶浓度动态的误差在35秒内，实时干预策略优于静态过滤器。

Conclusion: AeroSafe 能有效降低空气传播病原体风险。

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of
occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper
introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

### [7] [A novel autonomous microplastics surveying robot for beach environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02952)
*Hassan Iqbal,Kobiny Rex,Joseph Shirley,Carlos Baiz,Christian Claudel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型机器人平台，用于自动检测和分析海滩上的微塑料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料是普遍存在的环境污染物，但检测和绘制其浓度分布仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用配备摄像头和近红外光谱传感器的移动机械臂系统，实时检测和化学分析微塑料。

Result: 实验表明，系统在操控精度和微塑料分类准确性上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该机器人平台为解决微塑料污染问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters, have
become a pervasive environmental contaminant that accumulates on beaches due to
wind patterns and tidal forcing. Detecting microplastics and mapping their
concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing
this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that
automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces.
This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera
mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments
candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of
organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle
is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto
the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in
real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is
shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and
high microplastic classification accuracy.

### [8] [Optimal Trajectory Planning in a Vertically Undulating Snake Locomotion using Contact-implicit Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02953)
*Adarsh Salagame,Eric Sihite,Alireza Ramezani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于简化动力学模型的蛇形机器人运动控制方法，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么忽略复杂交互，要么过于关注复杂交互（如挖掘运动），缺乏基于简单刚体动力学的中间范式。

Method: 引入基于Moreau微分包含数学的降阶模型，并通过仿真和实验验证模型准确性。

Result: 模型在仿真和实验中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为蛇形机器人运动控制提供了新的理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet
rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact
planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on
emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns
using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or
focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However,
models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are
based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the
challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain
absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations
and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order
model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion
mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.

### [9] [Robot builds a robot's brain: AI generated drone command and control station hosted in the sky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02962)
*Peter Burke*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AI生成无人机控制系统，无需人工编码，实现实时控制和任务执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在自主机器人设计和开发中的潜力，减少人工编码需求。

Method: 使用AI模型生成无人机控制代码，部署到真实和虚拟无人机上。

Result: AI生成的代码在开发速度和功能完整性上优于人工编码，但存在局限性。

Conclusion: AI驱动的机器人控制代码生成具有潜力，可能改变机器人工程范式。

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models
(LLMs) and hybrid reasoning models present an opportunity to reimagine how
autonomous robots such as drones are designed, developed, and validated. Here,
we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human
input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a
real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed
and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone
in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry,
autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated
through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line
of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance,
code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded
architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete
command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,
though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context
window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of
AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as
emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work
sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more
broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future
robots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial
intelligence. In this initial work, a robot built a robot's brain.

### [10] [Physics-informed Neural Time Fields for Prehensile Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02976)
*Hanwen Ren,Ruiqi Ni,Ahmed H. Qureshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型多模态物理信息神经网络（PINN），用于高效解决物体操作任务，无需专家数据，且在复杂环境中快速规划轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物体操作方法效率低、依赖专家演示或试错学习，不适用于实际场景。

Method: 采用多模态物理信息神经网络，学习解决Eikonal方程，并动态调整抓取策略。

Result: 在仿真和实际场景中验证，性能优于基线方法，训练高效，规划时间短，成功率高。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种物体上表现优异，适用于复杂环境，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various
daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the
robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the
cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations
are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert
demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for
practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal
physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks.
Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert
data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered
environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the
robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and
compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that
our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training
compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance
in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates. Our demonstration
videos can be found at https://youtu.be/FaQLkTV9knI.

*Lucas Chen,Guna Avula,Hanwen Ren,Zixing Wang,Ahmed H. Qureshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一方法，结合人类显性和隐性偏好，实现机器人抓取和手递物体操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预设目标物体，未考虑人类偏好，限制了人机交互的自然性。

Method: 通过人类语言和非语言指令选择目标物体，并结合偏好生成机器人抓取和手递动作序列。

Result: 真实实验和用户研究表明，该方法能有效理解人类偏好，完成手递任务。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了人机交互的自然性和效率。

Abstract: Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that
aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and
factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on
pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and
explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction
between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target
object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should
grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during
handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects
target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs
the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit
preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences.
We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world
experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of
these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in
handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences. Our
demonstration videos can be found at https://youtu.be/6z27B2INl-s.

### [12] [Estimation of Aerodynamics Forces in Dynamic Morphing Wing Flight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02984)
*Bibek Gupta,Mintae Kim,Albert Park,Eric Sihite,Koushil Sreenath,Alireza Ramezani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文研究了两种估算仿生扑翼机器人Aerobat气动力的方法：基于物理的共轭动量观测器和神经网络回归模型，两者在实验中表现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估算气动力对扑翼机器人的控制、建模和设计至关重要，尤其是实现闭环飞行控制。

Method: 1. 基于哈密顿力学的共轭动量观测器；2. 多层感知机（MLP）神经网络回归模型。

Result: 两种方法在三个力分量（Fx, Fy, Fz）上表现一致。

Conclusion: 共轭动量观测器和神经网络回归模型均能有效估算气动力，为闭环控制奠定基础。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is essential for advancing the
control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic
morphing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate two distinct methodologies
for force estimation on Aerobat, a bio-inspired flapping-wing platform designed
to emulate the inertial and aerodynamic behaviors observed in bat flight. Our
goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a
crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a
physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the
concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on
the robot. This observer builds on the system's reduced-order dynamic model and
utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training
data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model,
specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint
kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic
force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a
high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force
measurements during periodic wingbeats. The conjugate momentum observer and the
regression model demonstrate strong agreement across three force components
(Fx, Fy, Fz).

### [13] [GACL: Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning with Active Task and Performance Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02988)
*Linji Wang,Zifan Xu,Peter Stone,Xuesu Xiao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning（GACL）的框架，用于机器人课程学习，解决了复杂任务空间和部分已知目标域分布的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人课程学习依赖人工设计，工程量大且可能主观或不优；自动课程学习在简单领域有效，但机器人任务复杂且目标域分布部分未知。

Method: GACL框架包含三个创新：1）统一处理复杂任务的任务表示；2）基于机器人当前能力的自适应课程生成；3）通过交替采样保持目标域相关性的接地方法。

Result: 在受限环境中的轮式导航和3D狭窄空间中的四足运动任务中，GACL分别比最先进方法提高了6.8%和6.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: GACL为机器人课程学习提供了一种高效且自适应的解决方案，显著提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current
capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain
relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.
We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and
quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1%
higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each
domain.

*Chenghao Wang,Alireza Ramezani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Husky Carbon机器人通过解耦控制架构和学习的接触残余动力学（CRD）实现了稳定的推力辅助窄路径行走。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统一MPC框架因低扭矩控制带宽受限，需解决推力辅助行走的控制问题。

Method: 采用解耦控制架构：Raibert型控制器负责腿部运动，MPC调节推力器，并通过CRD学习腿-地碰撞动态。

Result: 实验表明，带CRD的解耦控制器在推恢复和猫步行走中表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 解耦控制结合CRD有效解决了推力辅助行走的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, serves as a
research platform to explore unification of posture manipulation and thrust
vectoring. Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters
enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path
walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing
both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address
this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control
bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs
legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the
thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for
leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck
while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact
dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both
simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control
architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery
and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.

Result: LiGen达到亚米级精度，比Wi-Fi基线性能提升50%以上，且在复杂环境中表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: LiGen是首个结合光谱指纹与GAN数据增强的室内定位系统，具有高精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate and robust indoor localization is critical for smart building
applications, yet existing Wi-Fi-based systems are often vulnerable to
environmental conditions. This work presents a novel indoor localization
system, called LiGen, that leverages the spectral intensity patterns of ambient
light as fingerprints, offering a more stable and infrastructure-free
alternative to radio signals. To address the limited spectral data, we design a
data augmentation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
featuring two variants: PointGAN, which generates fingerprints conditioned on
coordinates, and FreeGAN, which uses a weak localization model to label
unconditioned samples. Our positioning model, leveraging a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) architecture to train on synthesized data, achieves
submeter-level accuracy, outperforming Wi-Fi-based baselines by over 50\%.
LiGen also demonstrates strong robustness in cluttered environments. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first system to combine spectral
fingerprints with GAN-based data augmentation for indoor localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在未知环境中，移动机器人需要同时处理自主探索和点目标导航两个任务，这要求机器人能够实时感知环境并更新其信念。

Method: 提出CogniPlan框架，通过条件生成模型预测多个可能的布局，并结合图注意力路径规划进行推理。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在仿真和硬件中验证了其高质量路径规划和实际应用性。

Conclusion: CogniPlan通过结合生成模型和图注意力路径规划，有效解决了未知环境中的路径规划问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging
capability for mobile robots, which primarily encompasses two coupled tasks:
autonomous exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must
perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential
information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose
CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible
layouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how
humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on
the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our
planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy
between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path
planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph
representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps,
yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We
extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic
floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further
deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its
high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: 通过设计深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，展示了750毫克扑翼机器人具备昆虫般的飞行敏捷性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫级飞行机器人在动态机动性上与真实昆虫存在显著差距，主要由于低惯性、快速动力学、扑翼空气动力学不确定性及环境干扰敏感性。

Method: 采用深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，并通过模仿学习方法训练双层全连接神经网络，实现高反馈速率。

Result: 机器人展示了侧向速度和加速度分别为197厘米/秒和11.7米/秒²的昆虫般急转动作，性能提升447%和255%。在160厘米/秒风干扰下仍能完成急转动作，并实现11秒内连续10次翻转。

Conclusion: 该成果标志着昆虫级飞行敏捷性的里程碑，为未来传感和计算自主性研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

Motivation: 受人类手绘导航启发，解决未见环境中仅凭草图导航的挑战。

Method: 开发自动化草图生成流程，提出SkeNavigator框架，结合RMD和DAGP技术。

Result: SkeNavigator在高度抽象验证集上SPL提升105%。

Conclusion: SkeNa任务和SoR数据集为草图导航研究提供新方向，SkeNavigator表现优异。

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Result: 在仿真和现实环境中验证了人形机器人在复杂环境中的导航和抓取能力。

Conclusion: 模块化方法有效解耦了视觉感知与物理动作，提升了学习效率和场景适应性。

Abstract: We propose Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery (HEAD), a framework that learns
navigation, locomotion, and reaching skills for humanoids, directly from human
motion and vision perception data. We take a modular approach where the
high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands
and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the
whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns
to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing
large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human
data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric
vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and
scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in
the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in
complex environments designed for humans.

Conclusion: 优化后的跑步步态在双足机器人上表现出高效性，且与人类跑步力学相似。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot
Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait
efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a
Bipedal Robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在2D图像中获取语义信息，但难以精确定位3D动作点，Point2Act旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出3D相关性场，结合多视角聚合和轻量级2D点级指导，实现任务特定动作的精确定位。

Result: 系统能在20秒内生成空间基础响应，支持实际操控任务。

Conclusion: Point2Act通过高效3D定位，为机器人零样本任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Point2Act, which directly retrieves the 3D action point relevant
for a contextually described task, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Foundation models opened the possibility for generalist robots that
can perform a zero-shot task following natural language descriptions within an
unseen environment. While the semantics obtained from large-scale image and
language datasets provide contextual understanding in 2D images, the rich yet
nuanced features deduce blurry 2D regions and struggle to find precise 3D
locations for actions. Our proposed 3D relevancy fields bypass the
high-dimensional features and instead efficiently imbue lightweight 2D
point-level guidance tailored to the task-specific action. The multi-view
aggregation effectively compensates for misalignments due to geometric
ambiguities, such as occlusion, or semantic uncertainties inherent in the
language descriptions. The output region is highly localized, reasoning
fine-grained 3D spatial context that can directly transfer to an explicit
position for physical action at the on-the-fly reconstruction of the scene. Our
full-stack pipeline, which includes capturing, MLLM querying, 3D
reconstruction, and grasp pose extraction, generates spatially grounded
responses in under 20 seconds, facilitating practical manipulation tasks.

Result: 在四足机器人运动和视觉导航仿真及四旋翼无人机实验中验证了安全性和任务性能的提升。

Conclusion: MPC-SafeGIL通过扰动注入和MPC方法有效提升了模仿学习的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex
robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make
errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in
safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach
that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial
disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader
range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn
robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive
Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to
high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work
that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates
safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach
through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor
navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating
improvements in both safety and task performance. See our website here:

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视觉语言模型（VLM）预判动态风险的零样本语言成本映射框架，显著提升了机器人在动态环境中的导航成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统依赖静态地图，难以应对动态风险（如突然开门的人），导致反应式而非预判式处理。

Method: 结合VLM解析视觉场景，评估动态风险，预分配导航成本，并与几何障碍地图整合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在模拟和多样动态环境中显著提高导航成功率并减少危险遭遇。

Conclusion: 语言成本映射框架有效预判动态风险，提升机器人导航性能。

Abstract: Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively
anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional
navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for
dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a
result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when
handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language
models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive
hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping
framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential
dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling
robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this
language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only
identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around
potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated
and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,
compared to reactive baseline planners. Code and supplementary materials are

Result: 分析了当前先进闭源大模型的不足，揭示了复杂长程任务的挑战。

Conclusion: CookBench将为未来研究提供开放基准，促进智能体在复杂物理世界中的规划能力发展。

Abstract: Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of
executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing
embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and
coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce
CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.
By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful
Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic
environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.
First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's
complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the
identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of
physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the
action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational
information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We
provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified
API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing
ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical
interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and
decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of
state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,
revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,
long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate
future research.

Result: 系统在HexGuide机器人上实现，实验表明能适应用户力指令并保障安全。

Conclusion: FC-MPC和CBFs有效结合，为复杂环境中的导盲机器人提供了安全、实时的导航方案。

Abstract: Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time
two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model
Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for
force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots.
FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and
moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS)
method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User
CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and
dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility
issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected
DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from
O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on
resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum
Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman
filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates
force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental
results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while
guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex
environments.

Motivation: 现有抓取数据集过于关注稳定性，忽略了功能性需求（如开瓶盖、握杯柄），且依赖昂贵的高自由度Shadow Hands。

Method: 基于仿生学，将人类自然动作映射到多种手部结构，利用几何力闭合确保功能性、稳定性和类人抓取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了功能性操作的准确性和抓取稳定性，支持跨多种机械手的高效泛化。

Conclusion: UniFucGrasp克服了标注成本和泛化挑战，为功能性抓取提供了高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

Result: 实验验证了该方法在不同浑浊度下的有效性，并在实际环境中进行了测试。

Conclusion: 该方法在浑浊水域中表现优异，代码已开源以促进社区参与。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots
navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based
reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale
information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting
conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This
work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is
specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to
identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of
interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to
corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data
from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental
comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying
turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source
to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement.

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，相比三种先进方法，成功率提高30%，计算成本相近且生成高质量（低旅行时间）解。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合学习与优化，显著提升了实时规划的安全性和性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort
and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose theatre-in-the-loop, a framework for developing
expressive robot behaviours tailored to artistic performance through a
director-guided puppeteering workflow. Leveraging theatrical methods, we use
narrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic
gestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and
curated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone
playback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise
sculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing
challenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this
practice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating
socially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an
interactive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation
methodologies between humans and machines.

Result: 实验在不同机器人数量、物体和任务中达到52%的成功率。

Conclusion: CollaBot框架在多机器人协作操作中表现出有效性，适用于多种任务和规模。

Abstract: A central research topic in robotics is how to use this system to interact
with the physical world. Traditional manipulation tasks primarily focus on
small objects. However, in factory or home environments, there is often a need
for the movement of large objects, such as moving tables. These tasks typically
require multi-robot systems to work collaboratively. Previous research lacks a
framework that can scale to arbitrary sizes of robots and generalize to various
kinds of tasks. In this work, we propose CollaBot, a generalist framework for
simultaneous collaborative manipulation. First, we use SEEM for scene
segmentation and point cloud extraction of the target object. Then, we propose
a collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp
pose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning
module that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.
Experiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,
objects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The integration of Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs) into pedestrian-heavy
urban spaces introduces unique challenges in terms of safe, efficient, and
socially acceptable navigation. We develop the complete pipeline for a single

and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset
sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and
depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance,
even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements,
including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7%
improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high
detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the
system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware

Abstract: Vibration suppression is an important capability for collaborative robots
deployed in challenging environments such as construction sites. We study the
active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools.
We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to
learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We
propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive
step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our
logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and
enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation
experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and
real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show
that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original
BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions.
Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further
validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments. A

Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses,
dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time.
This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary
robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online
Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates
learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates
handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live
scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to
adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a
dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected
environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary
adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We
validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze
navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水道图表（IENC）缺乏实时细节，传统LiDAR SLAM在水道环境中表现不佳，导致垂直漂移和非语义地图，阻碍自主导航。

Method: Inland-LOAM结合改进的特征提取和水面平面约束，通过体素几何分析将3D点云转换为结构化2D语义地图，并自动提取岸线。

Result: 在真实数据集上，Inland-LOAM定位精度优于现有方法，生成的语义地图和岸线与实际情况一致。

Conclusion: Inland-LOAM为内河水道自主导航提供了可靠的数据支持，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Accurate geospatial information is crucial for safe, autonomous Inland
Waterway Transport (IWT), as existing charts (IENC) lack real-time detail and
conventional LiDAR SLAM fails in waterway environments. These challenges lead
to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.
  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It
uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to
mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into
structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling
real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An
automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight,
IENC-compatible format.
  Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior
localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic
maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data
for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly
available
