However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual\ntimestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our\nresults demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the\nbaseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal\nachieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate\nby nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear\ntrade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while\nscenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that\nintelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and\nreliable autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8106\u5f31\u548c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u516d\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\uff09\uff0c\u5728Waymax\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e03\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6CQL\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u4ece16.0%\u964d\u81f35.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

This paper presents SignLoc, a\nglobal localization method that leverages navigation signs to localize the\nrobot on publicly available maps -- specifically floor plans and OpenStreetMap\n(OSM) graphs -- without prior sensor-based mapping. SignLoc first extracts a\nnavigation graph from the input map. It then employs a probabilistic\nobservation model to match directional and locational cues from the detected\nsigns to the graph, enabling robust topo-semantic localization within a Monte\nCarlo framework. We evaluated SignLoc in diverse large-scale environments: part\nof a university campus, a shopping mall, and a hospital complex. Experimental\nresults show that SignLoc reliably localizes the robot after observing only one\nto two signs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SignLoc\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5bfc\u822a\u6807\u5fd7\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5168\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5efa\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bfc\u822a\u6807\u5fd7\u548c\u5730\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u548c\u8857\u9053\u5730\u56fe\uff09\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f88\u5c11\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u3002", "method": "SignLoc\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5bfc\u822a\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\u4e0e\u56fe\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u5927\u5b66\u6821\u56ed\u3001\u8d2d\u7269\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u533b\u9662\u7efc\u5408\u4f53\uff09\uff0cSignLoc\u4ec5\u9700\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u6807\u5fd7\u5373\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u5b9a\u4f4d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "conclusion": "SignLoc\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5bfc\u822a\u6807\u5fd7\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5efa\u56fe\u3002"}}

Despite progress in pixel-level Image-Based Visual\nServoing (IBVS) control, the requirement of continuous visibility and the\nexistence of complex disturbances, such as parameterization error, measurement\nnoise, and uncertainties of payloads, could degrade the surgeon's visual\nexperience and compromise procedural safety. To address these limitations, this\npaper proposes VisionSafeEnhanced Visual Predictive Control (VPC), a robust and\nuncertainty-adaptive framework for autonomous laparoscope control that\nguarantees Field of View (FoV) safety under uncertainty. Firstly, Gaussian\nProcess Regression (GPR) is utilized to perform hybrid (deterministic +\nstochastic) quantification of operational uncertainties including residual\nmodel uncertainties, stochastic uncertainties, and external disturbances. Based\non uncertainty quantification, a novel safety aware trajectory optimization\nframework with probabilistic guarantees is proposed, where a\nuncertainty-adaptive safety Control Barrier Function (CBF) condition is given\nbased on uncertainty propagation, and chance constraints are simultaneously\nformulated based on probabilistic approximation. This uncertainty aware\nformulation enables adaptive control effort allocation, minimizing unnecessary\ncamera motion while maintaining robustness.

We\ndemonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a\nUnitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach\nsupports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.\nWe also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream\ntasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all\nbaselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.\nOur results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that\nenables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,\nrepresenting a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic\nsystems.

Cognitive science\nsuggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived\nrepresentations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves\nverbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term\nmemory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a\nCognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A\npretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens\nthat form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores\nlow-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory\nretrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with\ncurrent tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these\ntokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware\naction sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks\nacross three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it\nachieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on\nBridge.
