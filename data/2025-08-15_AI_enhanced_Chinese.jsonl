We propose a novel\nWiFi-based localization framework that leverages ubiquitous wireless\ninfrastructure and the OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for large-scale indoor\nenvironments. Our approach integrates signal propagation modeling with osmAG's\ngeometric and topological priors. In the offline phase, an iterative\noptimization algorithm localizes WiFi Access Points (APs) by modeling wall\nattenuation, achieving a mean localization error of 3.79 m (35.3\\% improvement\nover trilateration). In the online phase, real-time robot localization uses the\naugmented osmAG map, yielding a mean error of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas\n(8.77\\% improvement over KNN fingerprinting) and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted\nareas (81.05\\% improvement). Comparison with a fingerprint-based method shows\nthat our approach is much more space efficient and achieves superior\nlocalization accuracy, especially for positions where no fingerprint data are\navailable.

Recent approaches\ntackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with\ngenerative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on\na diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.\nWhile achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that\nmay lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,\nthe stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of\ngenerated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,\nit can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work\nfocuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either\nwith large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.\nInstead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that\nfilters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while\nkeeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,\nwe propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for\nactions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper\nstate.

We designed a hierarchical\ncontrol policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with\ndiffering levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and\ndeployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance\nunder nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach\na level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined\nthreshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary\ncontrol policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)\npolicy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring\nstability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system\nrobustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a\nhigh-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during\noperation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently\nsevere such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would\njeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC\npolicy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while\nadhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg\nWMR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNN\uff09\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\uff08RAC\uff09\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u578b\u8f6e\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08WMR\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u578bWMR\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u56fd\u9645\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u6545\u969c\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9ed1\u76d2DNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ecDNN\u4e3b\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\uff08\u4f4e\u5c42RAC\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u76d1\u63a7\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57286000\u516c\u65a4WMR\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408DNN\u548cRAC\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u578bWMR\u3002"}}

While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature\nto characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,\nlittle work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are\nable to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to\nmodel specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.\nIt is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction\nwith and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In\nthis paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based\non models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a\nlarge self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss\nfunction, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both\nclassification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that\nthe best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1\nscore of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model.
