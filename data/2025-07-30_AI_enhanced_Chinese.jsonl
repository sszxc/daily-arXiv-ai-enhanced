This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,\ntransforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes\nwithin sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile\nsensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials\nor designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material\nfabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric\nmodel to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately\npredict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the\nfingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,\ndemonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile\nfeedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading\nconditions.

We measured gait performance and perceived\nbody images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each\ntraining session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot\nsystems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking\nwith a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more\ncertain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor\nlearning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal,\nindicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into\ntheir sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination.\nHowever, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained,\nlikely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis\nfrom wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training\nsessions might limit further motor improvement.

However, the small size and fragility of retinal veins, coupled\nwith the need for high-precision, tremor-free needle manipulation, create\nsignificant technical challenges. These limitations highlight the need for\nrobotic assistance to improve accuracy and stability. This study presents an\nautomated robotic system with a top-down microscope and B-scan optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) imaging for precise depth sensing. Deep\nlearning-based models enable real-time needle navigation, contact detection,\nand vein puncture recognition, using a chicken embryo model as a surrogate for\nhuman retinal veins. The system autonomously detects needle position and\npuncture events with 85% accuracy. The experiments demonstrate notable\nreductions in navigation and puncture times compared to manual methods.

This letter\npresents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored\nfor loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic\nmanipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the\nquadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples\nlocomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with\na full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control.\nThis decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in\na receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories\ngenerated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear\nwhole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque\ncommands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control\narchitecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware\nexperiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg\n4-DoF Kinova arm.
