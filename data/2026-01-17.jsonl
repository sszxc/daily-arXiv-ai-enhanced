However, these data-driven components often operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Autonomous vehicles operate in dynamic, mixed-traffic environments where interactions with human-driven vehicles introduce uncertainty and safety challenges. This work develops a formally verified safety framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) that integrates Barrier Certificates (BCs) with interpretable traffic conflict metrics, specifically Time-to-Collision (TTC) as a spatio-temporal safety metric. Safety conditions are verified using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, and an adaptive control mechanism ensures vehicles comply with these constraints in real time. Evaluation on real-world highway datasets shows a significant reduction in unsafe interactions, with up to 40\\% fewer events where TTC falls below a 3 seconds threshold, and complete elimination of conflicts in some lanes. This approach provides both interpretable and provable safety guarantees, demonstrating a practical and scalable strategy for safe autonomous driving."}

However, their successful implementation requires not only technical robustness but also context-sensitive, co-designed solutions. This paper presents Mobirobot, a socially assistive robot developed to support mobilisation in children recovering from trauma, fractures, or depressive disorders through personalised exercise programmes.\n  Methods: An agile, human-centred development approach guided the iterative design of Mobirobot. Multidisciplinary clinical teams and end users were involved throughout the co-development process, which focused on early integration into real-world paediatric surgical and psychiatric settings. The robot, based on the NAO platform, features a simple setup, adaptable exercise routines with interactive guidance, motivational dialogue, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and no-code system feedback.\n  Results: Deployment in hospital environments enabled the identification of key design requirements and usability constraints. Stakeholder feedback led to refinements in interaction design, movement capabilities, and technical configuration. A feasibility study is currently underway to assess acceptance, usability, and perceived therapeutic benefit, with data collection including questionnaires, behavioural observations, and staff-patient interviews.\n  Discussion: Mobirobot demonstrates how multiprofessional, stakeholder-led development can yield a socially assistive system suited for dynamic inpatient settings. Early-stage findings underscore the importance of contextual integration, robustness, and minimal-intrusion design. While challenges such as sensor limitations and patient recruitment remain, the platform offers a promising foundation for further research and clinical application."}

Ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency in such settings requires that robots are endowed with a model of how humans move around them. Human motion prediction around robots is especially challenging due to the stochasticity of human behavior, differences in user preferences, and data scarcity. In this work, we perform a methodical investigation of the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, as well as human productivity and impressions. We design a scenario involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace and instantiate it in a user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms, conducted across two sites from different world regions. Key findings include evidence that: 1) the widely adopted average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions; 2) the common assumption of human cooperation breaks down in constrained environments, with users often not reciprocating robot cooperation, and causing performance degradations; 3) more efficient robot navigation often comes at the expense of human efficiency and comfort."}

We present SyncTwin, a digital twin framework that unifies fast 3D scene reconstruction and real-to-sim synchronization for robust and safety-aware grasping in such environments. In the offline stage, we employ VGGT to rapidly reconstruct object-level 3D assets from RGB images, forming a reusable geometry library for simulation. During execution, SyncTwin continuously synchronizes the digital twin by tracking real-world object states via point cloud segmentation updates and aligning them through colored-ICP registration. The updated twin enables motion planners to compute collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories in simulation, which are safely executed on the real robot through a closed real-to-sim-to-real loop. Experiments in dynamic and occluded scenes show that SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and motion safety, demonstrating the effectiveness of digital-twin synchronization for real-world robotic execution."}

With insufficient force the task may fail, while excessive force could cause damage. The high cost, bulky size and fragility of commercial force/torque (F/T) sensors have limited large-scale, force-aware policy learning. We introduce UMI-FT, a handheld data-collection platform that mounts compact, six-axis force/torque sensors on each finger, enabling finger-level wrench measurements alongside RGB, depth, and pose. Using the multimodal data collected from this device, we train an adaptive compliance policy that predicts position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for execution on standard compliance controllers. In evaluations on three contact-rich, force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, and lightbulb insertion), UMI-FT enables policies that reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines that lack compliance or force sensing. UMI-FT offers a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations. We open-source the hardware and software to facilitate broader adoption at:https://umi-ft.github.io/."}

Existing methods either maintain all-time connectivity, rely on fixed schedules, or adopt pairwise protocols, but none adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, resulting in suboptimal coordination. To address this gap, we propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication. Our approach integrates a branch-and-bound architecture that jointly encodes task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function that balances task efficiency against communication latency, and a communication event optimization module that strategically determines when, where and how the global connectivity should be re-established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 22.4% higher task completion rate, reducing communication overhead by 58.6%, and improving the scalability by supporting up to 100 robots in dynamic environments. Hardware experiments include the complex 2D office environment and large-scale 3D disaster-response scenario."}

Existing gantry-based systems achieve high accuracy but lack mobility, while mobile platforms struggle to maintain print quality on uneven ground. We present a framework that tightly integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with multi-modal sensor fusion and hierarchical hardware control, forming a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system. The AI module learns terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation rather than reactive correction. This intelligence is embedded into a three-layer control architecture: path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, and precision hardware execution. Through outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities, we demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility. This AI-hardware integration establishes a practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments."}

From a minimally extended data schema, the tool constructs the facet-hinge graph, extracts a minimum cycle basis that captures all constraints, and assembles a velocity-level constraint matrix via screw theory that encodes coupled rotation and translation loop closure. The framework computes and visualizes deploy and fold motions across diverse RFS while eliminating tedious and error-prone constraint calculations."}

Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions. The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments."}

These events are especially important for robotic hand designs, including prosthetics, as they can greatly improve grasp stability. Most presently published robotic hand designs, however, implement them in vastly different densities and layouts on the hand surface, often reserving the majority of the available space. We used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, based on their impact on reinforcement learning. Our two-setup system allows for robust results that are not dependent on the use of a given physics simulator, robotic hand model or machine learning algorithm. Our results show setup-specific, as well as generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations, and we identify one configuration as consistently yielding the best performance across both setups. These results could help future research aimed at robotic hand designs, including prostheses."}

However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them. These are then incorporated into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories. Experiments in simulation and in a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities. We release our framework, CHORAL, as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams."}

Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases. Notably, the proposed approach served as the champion solution in the Canton Tower Robot Run Up Competition."}

However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning."}
